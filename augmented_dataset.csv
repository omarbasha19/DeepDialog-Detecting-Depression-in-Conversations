"A Okay, good to go. Okay, so put this right here. Actually, let me move this so it doesn't get caught on your foot. Perfect. Okay. When she's done, she'll let you know. You can press that button. B Okay. A Thank you. B Thank you. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confident. Are you okay with this? B Yes, I am. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm okay. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B Chicago. A Really? When did you move to la? B Back and forth over the years and traveled a little bit. A How often do you go back to your hometown town? B Haven't been out there in over 15, 16 years. A Wow. Why? B Kind of got stuck out here then I had my baby and I just stayed. A How does it compare to la? B Different food. The people get a long way. How do I get it? It's kind of a culture shock. A Can you tell me about that. B Out there? Just on the food basis, they like to give you a lot of food that tastes real good for a little bit of money to keep a lifelong customer. But out here, they want to go up there and give you little bit of food for a whole lot of money, so they just make the money. A Why did you move to la? B My parent had business out here. A How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B Not hard. I could get used to anywhere. A That's good. What are some things you really like about la? B The views in the ocean. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B Just splitting of people. That's it. A I'm sure. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B Just a few places. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Getting to see different people and learn how different people get along and interact with each other. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B I remember a trip years ago where I went to Mexico with my brother. A Nice. B Yeah. Jumping into a lake pretty much off the side of a mountain. A Awesome. B Yeah. A What do you study at school? B Everything. It's not a subject I don't like. A What's your dream job? B Actually, my dream job, working with computers and helping people. A Really? Why? B That's where my heart is. I like computers and I also like helping people. A That's great. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I meditate, work out, I run, I walk, I write, read. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B In the median. A Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? B I'd say very good. A When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? B Oh, yeah, that doesn't make it seem that good. Last time I argued was over someone actually spitting out a racial slurp towards my wife. A Oh, no. How did you feel in that moment? B Angry, upset, hurt. Disrespected. And especially when I went up there to treat the person. Actually, I was treating them with dignity and respect and trying to help the person at first. A I'm sorry to hear that. B No problem. People are people. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. B Mm. I had a chance in school to really go a lot further than I did, and I let something very smooth, small and meaningless stop me in the pursuit of it. A What made you decide to do that? B Ignorant, for lack of a better word. A Could you have done anything to avoid it? B Now that I think back on it, I could have done a whole lot to avoid it, But. But I was just young and foolish. A Yeah. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B To start loving again. A Okay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Um. As much pain as I've seen in the world. A Can you tell me about that? B Um. A compilation of all the events, just different bad things that I've seen. Like, if I could change it, I would. But sometimes I guess things are there for a reason, even though we may not understand it. A I see what you mean. What's something you feel guilty about? B I have no answer to that. A Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B Blood. Family. Really? Don't talk. My wife. Don't know if she really wants to be there with me or not. She thinks that I'm doing everything in the world, but that I'm not. And really, I don't understand. I know my daughter loves me, but I don't know if she wants to be with me or not. A Why? B Because when somebody talks to you, when they say something a certain amount of times, and the tone, it's in a voice and a belief in their eyes. If you say something so many times, what really lies in your heart so you could say whatever through your mouth, but it's what really is there. A I see. Tell me about your kids. B I love my daughter. She's an angel. I cut her umbilical cord. I went up there and put on her first shirt. I seen her come out. She looked at me right out the stomach. She was fighting with the doctors, wouldn't let them touch her a bit. I talked to her. I told her to calm down. I told her it was Daddy. She looked up at me, grabbed my fingers and. And, like, just calm down and just let them do everything they needed to do. A Do you find it easy to be a parent? B No. It's constantly changing tasks. What you have to do on this day won't be the same thing as the next or the next after that. It's constantly. What is a better word for it? Adjusting. A What's the hardest thing about being a parent? B The hardest thing, I'll probably say, is scolding your child because you know you're doing it out of love for not learning the wrong lessons. A What's the best thing about being a parent? B Seeing your baby smile and appreciation. A What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? B I try to guard my baby a lot more from things that she sees. A Can you give me an example of that? B When I was younger, there were a lot of things that I seen that no child or adult should have seen. And when I grew up, I swore to myself that I'll always take care of my child and I wouldn't disappear or let her be around things like that. A Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Um, our foster parents. A Can you tell me about that? B Mmm. They basically showed me, no matter where you come from, you can always strive to get better. A Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B A good night's sleep? It comes the same. Just tired of yarning. A How have you been feeling lately? B How have I been feeling? Like I have a wealth of queries and a wealth of gold within my grasp, and it's just right out of my reach because I just need that one connector to really just see what I'm capable of. And I know I'm capable of a lot. It's just. I need to make that connection. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B No. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Not ptsd, no. A Are you diagnosed with depression? B Said yes. But I don't figure I'm any more depressed or anything than any other person. Everyone has their different breaking points. A Okay. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B My daughter's birthday on the 26th. A Can you tell me about that? B Took her out to Chuck E. Cheese. She had fun. She played games. She was on bikes. She was crawling through puzzle games. Man. Scroll. Did about everything. A That sounds like a great situation. How would your best friend describe you? B Fun, loyal, caring. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Something to change. I would like to be more accurate. A Okay. Is there anything you regret? B Not getting to know who my mom was. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Stop thinking about whatever else has happened and just do what you need to do. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm positive. I'm goal oriented, determined. I'm very imaginative, very creative. A Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B Ideal? I probably be doing a little bit of everything. Rock climbing, biking, hiking, going with my daughter. Places, man. I'll probably be skiing, snowboarding and everything in an ideal weekend. A What are you most proud of in your life? B My daughter. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B No problem. A Goodbye. B Goodbye. One part didn't make sense to sit. You could tell by my shoes.

"A Okay, thank you. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. A Okay. B Please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Yes, I am. B Okay. So how are you doing today? A I'm good, thank you. B That's good. Where are you from originally? A Originally from Los Angeles and my parents are from Central America. B Really? A Yes. B What are some things you really like about la? A The weather. I like that I can get to the water if I want to, to the hills or hike or just any element that I want to get to, I can get to. B What are some things you don't really like about la? A Traffic, busyness. Everybody's always in a hurry. That's about it. B I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? A When I can. I have family in Central America when I can. My husband and I, we try to go to warm places like Mexico or somewhere in the Caribbean. B Nice. What do you enjoy about traveling? A The freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something I said I would do. If I'm at home, and if I'm too far away from home to do it, then I don't have anything to worry about. B I'd love to hear about one of your trips. A Recently I went to Honduras again. That's where my family is from. So it's sort of like a. It's a dual fold. I get to see my family, but I also kind of get to be away from home. So I do it by not imposing on them. I visit them, but I stay in a hotel. So that way I can still kind of have my freedom and not feel like I'm obligated to being with them. So it's more fun that way. B That makes sense. What's one of your most memorable experiences? A Experiences on vacation or most memorable experience? Probably Hawaii and Lahaina. And just having. I love food, I'm a foodie, so having the pig roasted underground and just eating it that way, I've never been able to taste it that way anytime else. So it's like a very memory. It's a deep memory for me because no matter what I do to my pork, it'll never taste like that. Pork in Lahaina. B Awesome. What did you study at school? A Business. And that was years ago, so I ended up in the marketing field. So I've enjoyed my business background. Did help me in the marketing field. B What's your dream job? A My dream job? Hmm. Well, I guess it would have to do with food. I love to cook and only reason I hesitate is because I love to cook, but I just do it for home and friends and family. If I were to turn into. If it were to turn into a job, I feel as if it would just not be as joyous or I wouldn't have as much fun as I do have it, you know, as I have now. But if I could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that I have in cooking every day now, then that would be my dream job. B Yeah. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A I'm outgoing. B Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank. Screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. A That's cool. B What do you do to relax? A Depends on where I'm at, if I'm wherever I'm at. Actually, the first thing I do is just kind of get a hold of myself. That way I'm always in control, no matter where I'm standing at and always say that I am my own peace. P E A C E so I just kind of just take a deep breath, assess my situation, figure out what I can control, what I can't control, and then proceed from there. But just sort of just kind of breathe and get a hold of myself first. B How are you at controlling your temper? A I'm actually very good. I'm actually very mild tempered to begin with. I don't really let anything agitate me. And so if I do feel myself just getting hot or if I just react, I just sort of just like I said, just do my own little self check. You know, I might have cussed, I might have went off for a second, but I do my own little self check and just say, you know what? Come on now, it's not worth it. This person's not worth it. This situation is not worth it. Be who you are and just stay there. B When was the last time you argued with someone? A Actually, it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and I was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kind of overlooking my feelings in it. And I didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if I wasn't feeling the way I was feeling. So I kept stressing my point in different ways. And then I found myself now in a debate. And then that's when I pulled back and said, no, look, babe, this is how I feel about it. I'm not asking you to make me feel any differently. I'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings. B How did you feel in that moment? A When I got to my own conclusion, I felt triumphant because the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how I felt, not for him to impose his, you know, he's very macho, kind of manly guy. I didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic. And so I said no, as long as I felt better because I felt understood and I felt heard. B Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. A Hmm, let's see. My son comes to mind. He's 22 years old and we have a very strange relationship right now. And it's okay. I'm okay with it. He's used to being a little bit more needy, so I think he assumed that I would just always go looking for him or call for him as opposed to waiting for him to call me. And I think it may be a very weird answer, but I wish early on in my life as his mother, I would have kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come and check on him. He doesn't live with me, he has his own place. But waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and, you know, try to make sure that he's okay. I think this is probably way more ethereal than you meant, but I would have done that differently. I would have mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age, meaning that I would have treated him more of an adult and then also not expected him to just kind of, you know, I would have killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him, if that makes sense. B Do you find it easy to be a parent? A No, it's not easy. You have to sacrifice. And beyond just physical things, you have to just make sure you put your kids needs ahead of your own. And I guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay, you're okay. So my son, my daughter, they both know I love them unconditionally. So my parenting has become easier the more and more I've lived in that truth. Where I'm not expecting anything from them, but then also not expecting any disrespect. So as long as we have that clear line of communication, whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect. B That's good. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? A Seeing them maybe make decisions that I wish they wouldn't make. It could be as simple as an outfit choice or as much as a career change, but having to sit back, watch them listen, be open, and then just kind of just be there, you know, if they want to talk about it, but then not also trying not to manage them, because I was also their age and I have to remember that I didn't want to be managed. And even if I made a mistake, I didn't want to be judged. So the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own and just sort of, kind of just waiting around. And luckily it's nothing major with my kids. But whatever that personal downfall is just kind of being there and not having and I told you, I told you so spirit on me. B What's the best thing about being a parent? A It's fulfilling knowing that, you know, I created this. You know, I planned both my kids. So it's just. It's a real. It's an honor that I was able to do it. It's an honor that they're healthy and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own. And it's like they're mini me's, but then they're also different than I am. And so it's fun just being able to allow them be who they are and just celebrate them as they are. So I'm enjoying that. B What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? A Wow. Completely. My parents immigrated here from Central America in the 60s. I was born the year after they got here. So their mentality was different. They wanted to come and get the American lifestyle, which was not a bad thing. It's just that their parenting style was more about making sure we had a home, making sure we had the shelter, of course, and food and clothes and schooling. But there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter, or my father to me as a daughter. So I had to kind of figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent. B Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. A Divorcing my first husband because I was going to be the one that toppled that Whole situation, he was a good father, just not a good husband to me. B And. A And after 20 years, I knew that I was gonna be the one to say, this is not working for me anymore. And since I did that, the domino effect was, this is not virtual. It happened. We ended up selling our house, dividing up the assets, and then living separately. And then my kids were kind of in between for a little while. And then I just made some decisions to where I didn't wanna go through so much court hassle. So I just did a Tina Turner and said, just give me my name, you keep everything else. So it was just a very hard decision by way of how it affected my kids. That's all I cared about in terms of losing everything physical and all the material stuff. I could care less. But it was hard because I knew it was going to affect my kids. And they were the only thing I was concerned about. B What made you decide to do that? A My husband and I did not, you know, see eye to eye on certain things regarding our marriage. I didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife. And that's just who I am. And those were the very areas that he didn't validate me in. He just kind of saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars, whether it was just travel or whatever the case may be. I'm not here to talk about that part of it. Bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of the sanctity of our home. And I was tired of just working and him benefiting from everything, but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife. And he wasn't prepared to change, despite all the counseling he went through. And I thought, well, this is not working for me and I have to take care of myself first. And I had low self esteem. You know, I wasn't perfect. I had a lot of things going on with myself. And I had to learn how to love myself in order for me to love my children. And then in order for me to get the love that I should get in return. B How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? A You know what? It's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day, I just, you know, good, bad, ugly, or indifferent, whatever mistakes I made that day, or whatever great thing went on that day. My goal in life is just to have peace of mind. So when I put my head down at night, I just. I ask myself, you know, did I do anything that I'm ashamed of today? Did I cross anybody Did I not do? You know, and I'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if I'm Pollyanna, but I believe in karma. I'm a God fearing woman. So I just want to make sure that I did everything I was supposed to do today. And if there's something that I can rectify, you know, I just make it a point to promise to myself to go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day. B How have you been feeling lately? A Really good. Light, you know, had some rough patches with the family individually. Like I said with my son. My daughter's a teenager, so she's kind of coming into her own. So that's a different relationship. She's opposite of me. I'm actually very easygoing, very bohemian style. She's very social, very, you know, just out there. So I'm having to just kind of find our balance. But overall, it's just, I won't complain. I'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle that I just kind of foster on my own every day. And I just enjoy my little mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not. B Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? A No, I haven't, thank God. B Have you been diagnosed with depression? A No. B Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. A Really happy. Let's see. It's at home. And I think it was when different things running through my head. I think when my daughter and I, my teenage daughter and I came to an understanding on our mother daughter relationship. I'm not trying to be her best friend, but yet that doesn't mean she can't talk to me. And I think when she came to me the other day and just kind of gave me a big hug from behind me without really saying anything, I really felt her just accepting herself. And she accepted the fact that I accept who she is as she is. So it was a very tame moment. Only she and I kind of knew about it, but it gave me just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me. B That's so good to hear. A Thank you. B How would your best friend describe you? A I'm easygoing. I'm fun. I'm just very, you know, a chameleon comes to mind. I just kind of acclimate to whatever situation I'm in. I'm very honest. I'm very real and just, you know, bold if I have to be. I'm just very adult. I'm an adult woman. And, you know, they would just describe my best friend Would describe me as someone that she can rely on, extremely reliable. I do as I say, I say what I do. And I just, you know, I don't. I don't deal with bs. B What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? A Hmm, what can I change about myself? Probably cosmetic things. Maybe I would just. That's not even true. Let me think. What are some things I would change about myself? Sounds weird that I would say nothing, really. I think I would just be a little bit more aware of others. I think. I'm sorry, super sensitive to others, but I think I would just be more aware, make sure that I'm not being selfish or I'm not tuning anyone out just because I want to get through my yoga or I want to do something else. I think I would just be more observant and aware of those around me to make sure I'm not offending anybody. B Is there anything you regret? A I don't have any regrets. I think about that all the time. And, you know, it's natural to go back and say, if I were in that situation, with the mindset I have now, what would I do? But the reality is that I know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me. So I can't very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret because I know I learned from it. Probably sounds very textbook, but that's true. That's just really how I live. So I believe that everything good, bad, ugly, or indifferent happened for a reason. I truly believe that. And my job is to take from it what I'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future. So I'm to take the hard knocks with the joys. B I understand. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A Be real with myself. That's one thing that took me 20 years to kind of get to just to kind of be honest with myself, to embrace who I am, to just, you know, get to know who I am, learn my own infrastructure, be comfortable with the. With the innate things that are a part of me. Don't try to re. Don't try to revamp myself or try to become something that I'm not. I would have still chosen the same marketing career. I would have still climbed the same corporate ladders, But I would have done it from a more internal place. Not that I lost myself in it, but in terms of my family life, I would have just been more true to myself. And that way I wouldn't have had any kind of resentments. B What are you most proud of in your life? A My family, my role as a wife, my role as a mother. I think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what, at the end of this life, this life in this body, in this leased vehicle that I'm in, all I'm going to do or all I'm going to be is an epitaph somewhere in a cemetery. And I'm always just true to that. I mean I've been always true to that from the time I was 18 and realized I wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that. I think that ultimately that's where my true fulfillment comes from. B Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. A Cool. B Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. A Thank you. B Goodbye. A Bye. That's cool. That's cool. B So I'm going to stop the recording and then get you all unhooked here.

"A Now, here it goes. All right, so when she's finished, I'll. B Just wait for a little alert since our button's not working. Okay. Come back to get you. All right, thanks. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started, and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yeah, go ahead. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Um, I'm okay. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B I grew up in Wisconsin and I lived in Colorado for a bit, and then I lived overseas for a little while, and then I moved to California. A Wow. Mm. When did you move to la? B I moved here at the end of June of last year. So I guess it's been, what, eight months? Something like that. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B At the most, probably twice a year. A How does it compare to LA? B Well, my hometown is all of 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows and barns and farms, so the opposite of la. A Why did you move to la? B It's a good question. I always wanted to live in California, but I had been living in the Central coast and I just had been coming down to LA like, once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff. So, yeah, things were changing in Santa Cruz for me. The client I had, who was really the main financial source, I had that relationship ended. So I was totally free to move and I thought, well, I guess I'll give LA a try and see what happens. So I gave it a shot and here I am. A How easy was it for you to get used to? B No, not at all. It's a very, very big city. I lived in Dublin in Ireland, which is also a big city, but, you know, European cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy. And. Yeah, so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging. And. And, well, so, yeah, I see what you mean. A I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B I love to travel. I love it. Yeah. I lived in Ireland and I traveled. I was in Morocco and I was in Costa Rica. I've spent some time in Mexico. So what do you enjoy about traveling? I love meeting new people, experiencing new cultures and, like, also not just seeing what's different, but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B Sure. Well, I guess I'm trying to think which was my favorite. I mean, there was amazing things about Morocco and Costa Rica both, but Morocco was incredible. It was like 12 days, and we went to three different locations. We went up in the Atlas Mountains, which are beautiful, and, yeah, it's a really, really cool culture, so it was fun. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B My trip to Ireland. I actually visited there, which is why I decided to move there. So my most memorable moment of that trip. I mean, there's probably dozens, but the first most memorable moment of that trip was being on a bus and leaving Dublin and going just out into the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is. I mean, it's. Everyone sees pictures of Ireland or, you know, you see it in films, and it's green and lush and gorgeous, but when you actually get there and experience it, like, the pictures don't do it justice. So it was incredible. A Awesome. B Yeah. A What did you study at school? B I have an undergrad degree in English and psychology and psychology minor, and I have a master's degree in women's studies. A Are you still working in that? B No, I use my English and psychology. I work in marketing communications, so I actually do sales. So, yeah, the psychology definitely comes into play. And so does my. I guess my undergrad degree in English. But really, like, I took that on and. And created something out of it because most people who get an English degree just teach, and I wasn't wanting to teach. A Yeah. What made you decide to do that. B To. I guess I'm not clear on the question. A Let's come back to that later. B Okay. A I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? B Wow. You know, my dream job is being a motivational speaker and trainer and coach and traveling the world, doing that and impacting people's lives and really contributing to people. A Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B My relationship's pretty good, actually. I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother, who had not. She was sporadic. I saw her sporadically growing up. I lived. My dad raised me, and then he married my stepmom, and they had two kids together. So I grew up. And I consider them like the family I grew up with. But I got in communication with my biological mother last May, and we've been. We've, you know, cleared things up and have been in communication since then. A So that's good. How did you feel in that moment? B Well, I'm not sure which moment you mean, but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother, it is very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future. And not just the future, but in the present moment with her. So. Yeah. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I'm shy. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B To relax? I do a number of things. I like to do yoga, although I don't have the money for it right now. I love to dance, I love to read. I love to go to the ocean and spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions. That really recharges my battery. Actually, probably more than anything else, I like to be with friends. I love art and trying new restaurants. Yeah, all those things are both relaxing. I guess they're relaxing in the sense that I feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life. So. Yeah. Yeah. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Um, depends if I'm driving. Not very good, but otherwise I'm pretty good at it. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Um, last time I argued with somebody probably would have to be. Oh, no, it was with the LA Times about the newspaper delivery. Yeah, that was the last time. A Can you tell me about that? B Yeah, the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that I take care of, it didn't show up and I didn't realize that it wasn't there until late, I don't know, afternoon, I think early afternoon. And then I called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after 10:30 in the morning, which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place. So, I mean, for a service that we pay for, for every day. So, yeah, I was really irritated. And then I found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me. So I was angry with the LA Times. I was angry with people who had forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me. Yeah, I was pretty frustrated. A Yeah. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. B Oh, wow. There are quite a few of those. Let me think about one. The other day, I had a phone call and I'm in a coaching program. And it was from one of the coaches in the program. She was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be. We have meetings every week, classroom meetings, and then we also have coaching calls because we have one particular coach we work with. And then she called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with someone who's not my coach. And. But that hadn't been explained to me as part of the program. So in that moment it just seemed to me like, oh my God, I have all these people I have to be accountable to and like, you know, I have to not just be accountable to them, but share private things that are happening in my life with these people. And it just was, I don't know. So, yeah, I wasn't, I wasn't angry. I was just, I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and, you know, and I talked it out with her and we got through it. But yeah, I could have certainly just been okay with whatever was being asked of me at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother. A Uh huh. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B The hardest decision. Wow. There's been a few. I guess moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision. No, it wasn't even the hardest decision. It was such an easy decision, actually. But telling my family about it was challenging. But the hardest decision was the first time that I moved away from my family. I was 28 and I decided to. I chose to move to Colorado and that was a pretty tough decision because at that point my family had been, you know, within an hour's drive of wherever I lived, an hour, hour and a half. And now they're going to be, you know, a 12 hour drive away or a plane ride away. So that was challenging. A What made you decide to do that? B Oh, lots of things. I loved Colorado. Colorado is a beautiful, beautiful state and the weather is so much better than Wisconsin. And at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor community in Colorado. So there were a lot more people who were in my age group and were single. That was another factor and were interested in the things I was interested in. So Colorado just seemed like a really natural fit. So yeah. And then I found a job that I liked. The pay was atrocious, but I found some work that was really rewarding. And so it all came together and I chose to move. A That sounds like a great situation. B Yeah. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep. B That was totally unrelated question. Relatively easily it just depends on like what time I go to sleep. If I'm out and I don't get home until 11:30, then, you know, then I go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired like I feel today. But generally I can sleep through the night. I've had some pretty anxiety ridden dreams the last couple of weeks, but even so, even when I wake up from those or if I, you know, stir from those, I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily. A Are they triggered by something? B Yeah, I'm sure they are. I mean, I'm in another transition state. I'm moving out of. Out of the house that I live in right now or take care of an elderly woman. Yeah. And I just, I have to find the financial means to support me in doing that. And it's. And she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being. She's exhausting and utterly depressing. So. Yeah. A How hard is that? B Living with her is pretty hard. Like it's probably the hardest thing I've ever done and I would never, ever choose to do it again if I honestly, if I knew what I was getting into, I don't think I would have said yes to the situation. A I see. How have you been feeling lately? B I feel trapped and helpless, like there's, you know, nothing I can. There's no way out of the situation that I'm in. No matter what I do, it doesn't get any better. I don't, you know, I'm not getting any kind of work that I want to do and my money's not working at all. So, yeah, it feels pretty crappy. A I'm sorry. B Thanks. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B I have in the past, yeah. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B Oh, a long time. I was 15, I think, or 14. So it was over 20 years ago. A What got you to seek help? B I was suicidal. A Do you feel down? B Oh yeah, I feel down. A Do you still go to therapy now? B I don't actually, no. A Why did you stop? B Well, I originally stopped. Stopped with my therapist because we had completed. I mean, we had worked on what needed to be worked on and I was no longer depressed. And then I began therapy again later on. I think it was in my early 30s. And then we ended that because I'd moved to Ireland. So. A Do you feel like therapy is useful? B Yeah, I mean, depending on the therapist and depending on your intention. Like I don't go into therapy thinking, oh, I'm going To be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years. I think that's ridiculous. I think you go into therapy to work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see and, you know, work through that situation and come up with a strategy for. Not just that, not just creating a solution in that area, but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever. A Yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Last time I felt really happy. Well, huh. Wow, that's pretty sad. It was at least a year ago. No, that's not true. It was when I saw my biological mother, which was last May. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B My best qualities? I'm very strong. Very strong willed. I'm very supportive and loving and nurturing. I'm easy to be around. I'm intelligent and. Yeah. A Is there anything you regret? B Anything I regret? I don't think so, no. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Don't take life too seriously. A Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B Oh, my ideal weekend. I spend some time at the beach. I spend some time with friends, either going out at night to a movie or just going out to a club or a bar or somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together. Maybe go dancing after. And Sundays I usually go to. And then I have brunch with friends and yeah, I go home and Sunday night I get ready for the next day. So. A Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? B Hmm. I am most proud of a few things. I mean, I've moved to places that I wanted to move to and so I've done things that have really spoken to me and have meant something, you know, been dear to my heart to actually achieve those. Those goals or those. Yeah, I've done things that I've wanted to do, like moved to Ireland and moved to California. A That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. B Okay.

"An important. I wonder if people really understand it. You know what I mean? Like, if people judge. Yeah, it's weird. B everything looks good. I'm going to do something just. R I did, like, the Ricki Lake Show with my friend and I saw myself on television. Oh my God. Yeah. But I ate. I was. I ate candy and I was going to feel like that. And then I looked at Lake Ricki, as, there must be something wrong in my eyes. Because I was like. She was like, right there. I don't know. Damn. And so I actually had to act. You know, I'm in the audience. But I had to pretend as if I was interested in what she had to say. But I looked. So I looked at her like that, as if there was something wrong with my eyes. No, I just saw. I was in a doctor's office and they had it and like. Oh, God. It was funny because there was these guys, like, who wink at me when I went out. It was fame. And I'm like, I couldn't pay Duiodian sitting there. It's like I hated every minute. But we have sewing machines. Free sewing machines. Sewing machines $ 200. That day it was. Yeah. So it was worth it. It was worth it. But I was so embarrassed. Yeah. Only if you get things, it's worth it. Otherwise, they are so stupid. The shows are so. I can't believe that that's why I don't watch television. It's so embarrassing. Okay, so I'm going to start the cat. B with you a little. A good. B I'm going to give you the doorbell again, so when it is finished, it will make you know. A good. Directly on. All right. It's so weird. Oh my God. I hope she is nice to me. I hope so. All right. Good morning. Oh, God. C hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? A yes. C agree. So how are you today? A fine. Just tired. I'm sorry to hear that. Where do you come from? A California. C really? A of Hollywood. What are the things you really like? A step too much. There are not too many things that I like about it. C agree. What are the things you really don't like at it? To the people. It is not clean. Too much crime. Too many drugs. C what you study at school. Makeup and hair. It seems interesting. A is. C do you still work? A little. C what are you doing now? A Not too much. I just survive. Very difficult. What is your dream work? A I become a little old to think of a career, but. But I probably want to get married and have a little security is everything. Be again a woman. C agree. How far are you from your family? A little close, but everyone is almost deceased. I play in Farmville on Facebook. It's great. One yeah. C How are you going to control your temperament? A I am good. I don't really have a temperament. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? R It was my ex-husband about money. What are the things that make you really crazy? A people. Lying, cheating, accomplice of drug addicts. You know, just ugly people. People who are hideous inside, do you know? Ah, Jesus Christ. That's almost everything. My mother, when she was alive, well, she always has a positive influence, but no one really, but Jesus. C agree. What is one of your most memorable experiences? Memorable experiences? I don't know. I can't really think about one at the moment. C What comes to your mind? A God. Memorable experiences. Oh, I guess maybe modeling. It was pretty cool. Yeah. C Nice. One yeah. C can you tell me? R I was just a little surreal, like seeing yourself in magazines and photos and stuff, you know. I did not understand how it could have been me, but my photographer told me that he was like, well, someone must do it. It might as well be you. SO. Too bad. And it's true. So it was cool. C What decided to do this? A kind of just fell by accident. I always have. I'm so much. Yeah. Yeah. I would like to have done it. I took it further, but I couldn't. C agree. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? A really happy? I don't remember. I really don't do it. C agree. How would your best friend describe you? R I don't really have a best friend, but I'm sure anyone would describe me as leaving. It's good. One yeah. C have you already served in the army? A N ° C Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? A yes. C How long have you been diagnosed with? A was in 1984. Yes. I couldn't face it, so I had to see a psychiatrist. What were your symptoms? A horrified. Couldn't sleep. Panic. Major anxiety. Yeah. C did you think you had a problem before discovering it? One yeah. Yes. Are you still in therapy now? Yes, I do it. C do you feel like the therapy is useful? A he could be. If you see the right doctor. If you if. Yeah. C How to see a therapist affecting you? A It gives you the opportunity To talk to someone and I hope they can give you answers. Most of them do not do so. They try to find the answers inside you and get it out of you. But it's just good to be able to talk to someone who is a little neutral. C How do you receive yourself recently? A truly depressed. Extremely depressed. Yeah. Poverty? Yeah. C have you noticed changes in your behavior? Rave yeah, I am much more tired, I sleep longer and I simply do not have the motivation of the reader that I did before. C How do you face them? Just try to be strong. Just go through, do you know? C there are always compromises in life, right? A yes, there are. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about it? A really step. I am an open book. It's good. One yeah. C what would you say that some of your best qualities are? A well, I would say a perfectionist, but it is not really good quality because it can become dangerous. I'm just artistic. I am gifted for many things. I'm really good in many things. Well, I am a good hairdresser and makeup artist. I crochet and knit really well. Make jewelry. Not good with computers or phones. Electronic. Yeah. I keep a perfect house or. Well, when I'm not depressed like that. I was a perfect woman. The perfect woman. SO. Yeah. But no longer because I am divorced now. But it was not me, it was him. So can you tell me? He was under drug, so he chose. Medicines were too many problems. Yeah, this is the case. How is it difficult? R it's really difficult because it's as if the drugs were his mistress. How me. What? C How do you know them? One who? Oh yes. No, well, I don't really consider myself an introvert. C agree. Is there anything you regret? A yeah, I have a lot of regrets. But I couldn't really do anything about it. It is therefore really useless to regret it because you do what you do and make a decision, then it's already done. So why regret it? Why bother? You know? This would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Make sure that when you marry a man, you ask him if he does drugs or alcohol. It is certainly one. It was the only question I didn't ask. I didn't know there were a lot. Lots of things. I don't know, just the things I can do. My talents. That's it. What are the things that usually put you in a good mood? A well, if I can have my Starbucks and my Orange Gina. I drink orange gina every day. I smoke cigarettes, unfortunately, but it's always good to have them because I am addicted for them. And then if I can eat something really good and healthy at night. Well, basically, if I have something to do, if I have a goal, somewhere to do, something to do. Like today, even puts me in a good mood. Yeah. Otherwise, I would be afraid to stay at home and lie down in bed or farm all day. I could cultivate for eight hours on Farmville. Yeah. C agree. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. You are welcome. Delighted to meet you. So I press the button. All right. You're good. She is good. Except for, you know, it's like the only eye. Can it hear me, by the way? The only eye always moves weird. Oh, right? Yeah, it's a bit distracting. Yeah. This one.

"A good. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? A yes. B ok. So how are you today? A I am fine. B is good. Where do you come from? A los Angeles. Really? B What are the things you really like at the? A convenience. Convenience. Things you don't really like in people. The crowd. Traffic. Not the lack of respect. B Yeah, I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? A locally? Regionally. B cool. What do you like on travel? A meeting with the elderly. I love talking to the elderly. B I would love to hear about all your trips. R I work a lot with my elders on my reservation and other reservations here in California, and I spend a lot of time with the elders. I talk to them and they help me a lot. So I hear good stories. B It's so good to hear. What is one of your most memorable experiences? Who goes to the mountains and seeing waterfalls that no one had seen with the exception of my people. It was the most beautiful thing I think I found. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? R depends on the situation. If someone comes to me looking for me to help them, I take control. But if I need help, it's. I work to ask for help. It therefore depends on the situation. B who makes sense. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? A I Garden and I paint. B well. How are you going to control your temperament? A I am very good in this area. B is good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it? Three days ago? It was a question of communication. It was the lack of communication from the other person. And I needed them to better communicate so that I could understand that they did not communicate. So we had an argument and I settled it. I felt caught up in it because he is an individual with whom I spend almost almost every minute of my day. And not to be informed of what was going on in the head of this person, then to have a situation and I was kept away. I didn't like it. B A situation you want to manage differently. A I prefer pass. B ok. What do you feel guilty? A lack of time spent with my grandparents. Is it. When they left, you regret that you have not lacked time by spending time with them. One thing I really want me to remember, I was a professional athlete at the same time. I celebrated until four in the morning, then I did my event at 10 a.m. and I was my team captain and I embarrassed my whole team. And that's something I really regret. I was a professional fighter. So yes, I did not celebrate other people except myself. B I see. What are you studying at school? I studied massage therapy. I graduated in nursing and a large part of professional education. B How far are you close? A very close. Due to my own injuries, to follow the therapy process and to believe in people and to see how it worked and I decided to do it. I also wanted to help people. B are you happy that you did that? A oh, yeah. B Do you still work in there? A yes. B What is your dream work? I want to paint. That's all I want to do, it's just painting. B awesome. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to make. R I have two sons and it's tight for me. To move on. And they are older and they can take care of themselves now. So me leaving the area where my sons are, it's quite difficult. B do you find easy to be a parent? One yeah. B What is the best thing to be a parent? A reflection of you. The reflection of you reminds you so much of you, who you are. B What is the most difficult thing to be a parent? A coherence. Even when you're sick. Be consistent. B What are the ways that you are different as a parent than your parents? R I don't assume that my children are right or wrong. I listen to them first. They make my decisions after that. And I try not to come from an increased emotional place. But I think that logically and I put myself in their place before doing it. We discuss. We communicate heavy in my family because it is the only way to hear us with each other is communication. So communicate. B tell me about your relationship with your family. A my family is almost cut. So my family, my relationship with my family on booking, is very tight. The rest of the family was all fragmented and dispersed in the southwest, so it is not very tight at all. B Who is someone who has had a positive influence in your life? R I have too much to count. Start with my uncle. My uncle was like my father, h I raised me in the right direction. He looked at me. He told me that he taught me hard at a very young age. He also taught me to protect my family and taught me the honor. I taught me love. He's a good man. B it's great. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? R I don't know. I haven't had a good night's sleep for years. Sorry. I sleep. Dreams. Dreams become too real. B How do you face it? A Levant and go to the toilet and fall asleep? I try. Are B triggered by something? In my years of fighting, just. It caught up with me. B How are you when you don't sleep well? A reserved. Reserve. And I try to find things to distract my brain, to think in different ways of doing things. B like what? A well, I got rid of television about eight months ago, so I got rid of this distraction. So what I do now is that I paint a garden or cleaning, wash the dishes, be out and go for a walk. This is another thing too. Make a lot of walking today. B is good. How do you feel recently? An anxious. A lot of anxieties. But that's good. I have techniques to drop. B Have you noticed these changes in your behavior or your thoughts lately? A UM, nothing new from normal. B ok. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? A yes. B For how long have you been diagnosed? In uh, three years ago there. Three. B What made you ask for help? Insomnia. B you are still going to therapy now? R It was about two years ago there. 2. A little over two years ago, I was released from therapy. B Why did you stop? The therapist has released me. B ok. What kind of changes have you noticed since you have been in therapy? One what I noticed is that I always take care of photos and emotions, but what I do is now that I train really hard to take care of myself and go to these places. The things that strike me, that put me anxious, excited or angry. I learned to work on it and realize that it is not real. It is not real. It's just emotion. It is not real. So these are things, like the little mantras that I tell myself. And it really helped me a lot of therapy because it taught me that these emotions and these images are really not real. Therapy has therefore helped a lot. I mean, that's right. It has changed my world. B Have you received a diagnosis of depression? A yes. B For how long have you been diagnosed? Has about the same time as the SSPT. About three years ago. B Do you have worrying thoughts? A in my dreams. When I dream, I do it. B WH The last time it happened? One last night. B Can you tell me? R I dreamed of fighting, then preparing fighters to fight. It was another thing too. I strengthen anxiety. Dreaming of preparing fighters to fight, then walking in front of thousands of people. And then I always end up fighting in my dreams. This is always what scares me in all my dreams, it is that I should have taken the plunge and finish the fight and I did not do it. And so it builds anxiety and stress in me. Then I tend to act from my sleep. B How did you feel at that time? One as it was real. As if I were there. As I feel, taste, feel everything. There. I was there. B It sounds really difficult. One yeah. B tell me about the last time you felt really happy. R This morning, driving here, speaking to my girlfriend. B How would your best friend describe you? A trustworthy. He loves me, I love him. We are the best friends. B It's so good to hear. What are the things you want to change about you? A I have none to change. B tell me about an era when someone made you feel really bad. R I don't remember. B ok. Is there anything you regret? A regret? I do not spend time with my grandparents and I think that daily problems, perhaps, you know, a couple here, there, that I should have gone to the store first or something like that, but I mean, it is nothing like it. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A stop to think that you know everything. Yeah. B would you say that some of your best qualities are? To my loyalty, my reliability. B tell me about something that you recently did that you really enjoyed. A started a new artistic project yesterday. It was nice. B Can you tell me? A well, we were in Santa Barbara and we found rocks, old rocks of which someone had made a heap and had just threw a dumping ground of old rocks away. And I crossed the pile of rocks and I found this old rock which was in the middle and I brought it home and now I do a work of art on it. And for me, it was as if this thing was totally forgotten. It was just considered a rock. And now he will sit at my table with grandchildren. For me, it's really cool. I like that. B awesome. What are you most proud of in your life? Something that starts that I am so bad that I don't think there is no way I can be good in this area. And all of a sudden, I can be better where I don't even have to think about it. Just so good in this area. In this way , I can just touch it and feel it and I don't have to think about it. These are the things I am proud of. Like, I like it. I like this achievement, I guess you can say. B Okay, I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. A farewell. Its left collarbone needs an adjustment. Its collarbone is above. It gives her the impression that she was in a car accident. She's like that. His left shoulder is higher and his squares pushed, so you left. And that draws my attention to this. So I don't know if you have noticed it too. The other part of it too is the movements of the hand it makes. Some of the movements of the hand are very aggressive in the wake. So it was very distracting at first because she was moving quickly. For example, my therapist, because we were working with the problems of the SSPT, he did everything slowly because I left for a quick tour, good movements. And so, as, with his hand movements like that coming like that, speaking, it was distracting at the beginning. But other than that, everything is like. It's pretty. I mean, it's a computer, but it is. I mean, you feel comfortable. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. B I'm really happy to hear that. A thank you.

"A All right, great. So now I'm going to give you the doorbell. When she's all through, she'll let you know. You can push that button to let me know. B Okay? A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing okay. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B I'm from Greenwich, Connecticut. A Really? B Yes. A When did you move to LA? B I moved here in 2008, so about five years ago. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B I try to go back at least once a year. Sometimes I go more, sometimes less. How does it compare to LA overall? I think I like where I'm from better than LA in general. I think that other than it being somewhere I'm familiar with the type of people that are there are just more my type and what I'm used to, and it's less superficial. A I understand. Why did you move to la? B I moved out here for college after I graduated high school, and my mom and sister live in California. A How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B Initially, it was easy because I felt like it was a new experience. So you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once. But then after the first few years, when it really sets in, how different it is and what life is out here, it became more difficult than originally. A What did you study at school? B Fine arts and photography. A That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? B I was interested in photography since high school. I did a lot of programs and got awards and things like that, and publishments. So I decided to pursue art. A Are you still working in that? B Yes, I have a fine arts degree that I got last year. A Awesome. Are you happy you did that? B Yeah, I really enjoy working or interning in forensics. I like that better than initially. What I wanted to do was freelance photography. I feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Um, that's an interesting question. I guess just my childhood in general, growing up. A Can you tell me about that? B Um, well, my family is very close, my extended family as well. And they all. Most of them live within the area or in the east coast. In General. So we would always do large family parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that. A That sounds like a great situation. B Yeah, it is really fun. And we try and all get together as much as possible, which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I consider myself more shy. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I watch reality television. I think it's kind of funny and light hearted. A Like what? B I watch like Bravo tv, like the Real Housewives shows and just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Um, I'm good, I guess. I don't really have like a temper if I'm having. If I'm more stressed out, it definitely shows in my attitude, but I don't really have like anger. A Uh huh. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Well, me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time. Just like about like insignificant things. But other than that. I had an argument with my dad a few days ago. A Can you tell me about that? B There's been like some tension going on since I went and visited over the holidays this past winter. Things about his girlfriend and he thinks that I should be the one to make some kind of effort to have a relationship with her. Although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways. So for like the 30th time he. We were on the phone and he was telling me how I need to call her and speak to her and I had told him that I was going to do it over this past weekend because of the Jewish holidays and, and he kind of was just like very immature and telling me, oh, forget it, she doesn't want to hear from you now. And kind of just like I could care less because I, I don't care about having a relationship with her. So if she doesn't want to hear from me, you know, it's easier for me. A Yeah, that sucks. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. B I mean, every time, I mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot. And I wish that I could. Sometimes I do. But I wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that I could just bite my tongue. But the thing is, is that he says certain things that are untrue. Or things he knows that like, will tick me off, that are really nasty and that he shouldn't be saying to me. So he. So I kind of just like lose it and I can't really like not say anything. A Yeah, I'm sorry. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Um. B Well, I guess the hardest decision I made, which I. It didn't. I only realize that it's the hardest decision, like looking back, is once you decide where to after you graduate high school, where to go to college. Because for me, I basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own. So it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time. It felt like just like a progression of the next step. But looking back now, that's probably one of the hardest decisions I made. A Okay, tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Um, well, I wish I could erase the event or seeing my grandmother's funeral, which obviously it wouldn't change anything, but it wasn't seeing her. There was not something I'd want to like, have in my memory. A Yeah. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B She was. She was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental. And now, I mean, my parents are great role models, just in general. I mean, they're very successful people. So whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people, they kind of are good role models. In terms of what you want to have when you are older, how easy. A Is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Usually it's easy. The problem is staying asleep. No matter how late I go to bed, whether it's 10:00pm or 4:00am, I will be up like clockwork by 7:30 or 8:00 in the morning. The latest every single day. And I can't seem to figure out why I cannot stay asleep longer. A Are they triggered by something? B No, I just. In the morning, I guess I'm a lighter sleeper, but I just wake up. Like I just cannot stay asleep anymore. Which never used to be a problem, this consistent, but now it's. I cannot remember the last time I slept past 8:30 in the morning. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B I mean, it just makes. If I have to do stuff during the day, it makes it a lot more tiring, but it doesn't really. I'm so used to it now, it doesn't really change my mood. It's just part Part of every day. A Okay. How have you been feeling lately? B I don't know, I kind of just feel very like. So, so just no extreme highs, no extreme lows. It's kind of one note, bland. A Have you, have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B I mean, nothing like lately, like recently. It's just I would say over a period of years I've kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and not very outgoing. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. I have been diagnosed with anxiety. A What got you to seek help? B I had some breathing problems for a day or two and I had to go to the hospital because I thought it was more serious because I couldn't breathe. But they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety. A Do you feel like therapy is useful? B I think in the right setting and with the person who's doing it, if they're open minded and the therapist is helpful and good at what they're doing, then yeah. A Do you still go to therapy now? B No, I haven't been to therapy since I was a kid. A Why did you stop? B I went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me. But it was never so. I mean, we just sat around and talked about my day. I didn't feel like I needed therapy at the time, so I didn't really get much out of it. A I see what you mean. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Well, I was happy when I was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the New Year's holiday. When I'm there, I can always just. We save up our money so it's a complete vacation. I don't have to worry about paying bills. I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow, who I have to deal with. I just. Every morning we wake up, we hang out, just enjoy the day. A That's great. Is there anything you regret? B In general? A Yes. B I regret the college I chose to go to, I didn't. Being from the east coast, the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently. And the university out there are not the same as like the tight knit California school system out here. So when I was researching colleges, I kind of thought that Santa Monica College was just a general college, just like Boston College back home or, you know, any other school with the name College at the end of it. I didn't realize until, you know, the end of my first year. Even that it was more like a transfer school. Like I didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when I went. So it kind of created more problems for me. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Well, considering I'm 22, I'd probably say 10 years ago I would give myself the advice to probably stay closer to home and to have really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to California. A How would your best friend describe you? B Um, my best friend would describe me as a great, charismatic, funny, outgoing, socially enjoyable person. Which is different than how people who aren't my good friends would describe me, which I mean, I don't. I mean, it is what it is. I am very outgoing and have a great time when I'm with my friends in my element, but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things. I just, I am very shy and don't really speak much. A Uh huh. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Recently. My friend was visiting and we went to a Clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed that. A Nice. B Yeah. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm very caring. I'm a very good judge of character, which, I mean, I guess, I mean, I consider it to be a quality for myself. I'm very. I mean, I'm not very affectionate. I'm more. I mean, I guess, I guess so. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. B Thanks.

"A Okay. So if you can just move around a little bit and our Xbox Kinect will pick up your body. B Okay. My arms. That looks good. Okay. A Okay, I'm going to do something now. Now I'm going to start up a virtual human. She'll chat with you for a bit and then she'll let you know when you guys are done. B Okay. A And I'm going to put the doorbell back over here. Let me know when you're done. B Alright, then. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yeah. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm okay. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B Chicago, Illinois. A Really? B Mm. A Why'd you miss Twillet? B My husband's work was here. A When did you move to LA? B In 84. A How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B It was not easy for me. It took about three years. A Wow. Can you tell me about that? B Just the move. I moved away from my family, so I was uncomfortable. I didn't know anyone here and even though I did make friends, I just felt out of place. Not as often as I would like. I used to go back at least once a year, but in the last few years that's diminished. So I would say like every three years. A Okay. What are some things you really like about la? B The weather. I love the weather. The beach, you know, as I've been here as long as I have, the people, you know, some nice people here. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B The people. Some of the people, yeah. Also I would say the economy. It's very difficult to make it here in Los Angeles. A Yeah. What did you study at school? B Business and computer graphics. A Are you still working in that? B I'm not working in IT right now. A What do you do now? B I'm working in retail. A How did you decide to do that? B I just couldn't find work and so I had to settle for doing that for right now. A It can be tough to find a good job these days. B It's very tough. A What's your dream job? B I would like to be a human resource representative. No, I like to talk to people too much and when I understand or I know a lot about a subject, I can go on and on about it. And I'm interested in finding out about people. If I'm sitting next to somebody, I'll strike up a conversation with them just to find out who they are. And just, you know, I like to talk to people. I enjoy it. A That's great. What do you do when you're annoyed? B I am quiet. A What are some things that make you really mad? B Let's see. Rude people, people that harm children and the elderly. That makes me very angry. War. I control my temper. I don't have a problem with that. I just get quiet when I. I feel angry and I try to think before I act. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B The last time I argued with someone was about a month ago, and it was with my daughter. And I was arguing with her over her therapy. She has cancer and she wasn't telling me enough. She wasn't giving me enough information. And so that made me very angry. I was frustrated and angry. A That sounds really hard. B Yeah, it was very hard. A Do you find it easy to be a parent? B No. A What's the hardest thing about being a parent? B Watching your children fail when they're trying hard or seeing that they can hurt themselves and trying to prepare them for that when they won't listen to your advice. I feel like sometimes they need to trust me more. A What's the best thing about being a parent? B The love of my children. Yeah. A When was the last time you felt really happy? B When I was playing with my granddaughter. And that was about a month ago. A How did you feel in that moment? B Very excited and happy and just all my cares were gone. I wasn't thinking about anything except for having fun with her. So it was a good time? Yeah, it's the best. A Have you ever served in the military? B No. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Yes. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B It was over five years ago. A What got you to seek help? B I couldn't function. I couldn't drive. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. I couldn't do anything. I was completely shut down. I felt like I was looking out a window and life was going on outside that window. And I was just stuck behind the glass. I couldn't participate. I knew something wasn't right. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling depressed. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B I haven't had a good night's sleep in a year. I would say I. My regular pattern is to maybe sleep in an hour, up to Three hour intervals, and I just keep waking up, and I never quite get into a deep sleep. A Okay. What are you like when you don't sleep well? B Groggy. And I have no energy. A How hard is that? B It's very hard because it's difficult to work. It's difficult to concentrate. I make mistakes and I forget a lot. A Thoughts? B Yes, I do. A Are they triggered by something? B Yes. A Do you still go to therapy now? B No, I'm not in therapy right now. A Why did you stop? B I could not afford to continue. A I understand. Do you feel like. Do you think therapy is useful? B I'm sorry. What? A Do you feel like therapy is useful? B I'm not sure. Yes. What sort of changes have you noticed since you. I feel more relaxed, and I feel like some of my worries are lifted from me. I have a. I can think clearer because I am using the tools that I've learned through therapy. A What are you most proud of in your life? B My children. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I don't know. A How would your best friend describe you? B Friendly. A That's good. What do you think of today's kids? B I think it's just horrible. A Can you tell me about that? B I feel that the children are so neglected today, and it's not the fault of the parents. I think that we, as a society, we forgot that it takes a village to raise a child, and nobody wants to pitch in. No one wants to help anymore. No one's helping their neighbor, and it's very sad. A That sucks. B Mm. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B I don't know. Eating dinner with my family. A That's so good to hear. Is there anything you regret? B I regret not spending enough time on my education. A How did you decide to do that? B I had children very young, so I needed to. Yeah, I needed to take care of them. A Could you have done anything to avoid it? B I'm sure I could have. A Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. B To seek help? A Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B My grandparents. A I'd love to hear all about it. B Just, they introduced me to church and just, you know, letting me play at their home and play in their garden. It just showed me a lot of love and. And I felt like I was cared for. A That's great. Do you travel a lot? B No. A Okay. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? B Listening to music, watching a funny program on tv. Going to school, working.

"A Now, oops. B Might have pulled something. A So I'm going to bring the doorbell back over here. When she says goodbye to you and says you're all done, press this button. B Great. Thank. Thanks so much. Thank you. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Oh, I'm fine. I'm a little tired, but I found out my thyroid is, I think, acting up. So. A Where are you from originally? B I was born in Canada, but I've lived in California most of my life, so. And it's gray today, too, so the gray weather makes you kind of, you know, sluggish. A When did you move to la? B Oh, my gosh, years and years ago. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B Not at all. I don't think I've gone back there for a long time. Well, the airfares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years. Gas prices have gone up. So travel. As much as it's a fun thing to do, it's cost pro prohibitive. So. A How does it compare to la? B Oh, let's see. Everything has plus and minuses. Cold weather, not as much sun, so I think I'd prefer getting more sun and having the warm weather. But other than that, it's very pretty back there. Natural scenery. But I like it here. You know, the traffic's kind of heavy, but that's a small thing to deal with. A I see what you mean. Why did you move to la? B Why did I move to la? Because my family came here and started. My dad got a job here and this became our home base, and that's why. How easy was it for you to. A Get used to living in la? B Easy, Very easy. So that's good. A What did you study at school? B Well, in high school, you generally study general ed. They have designated courses. And then after that went to college and I was a business major. Let's see, I was a veterinary major and I graduated with a degree in liberal arts. A So what made you decide to do that? B I don't know. Can't really pinpoint why. A Okay. Are you still working in that? B I was working in social services, but I've also worked in sales and most recently I'm doing real estate. I'M a leasing consultant part time. A Are you happy you did that? B I mean, everything has plus and minuses. It's okay. I don't really see too many negatives. A What's your dream job? B Oh, probably to work as a gossip columnist at TMZ or one of those networks. But as you know, everything in the entertainment business is very competitive. It's who you know, so. But that would be my dream job. Or probably working with cats, you know, animals. So. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I'm very outgoing. In fact, I think I'm so outgoing, I scare people sometimes. There's a lot of quiet, reserved people out there, so I'm kind of east coast, very. You know, I go up to people and talk to them. Very social. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B Oh, my gosh. There's. I could do hundreds of things. I could read. I could watch a show, turn on the music. Music is great. Take a walk, call my friends. Million things. So how are you expecting, controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. I'm very good. I mean, you know, of course, when you're driving in LA and somebody cuts in front of you, sometimes that can be irritating. But I'm. I'm actually pretty. I'm not the type of person that will fight or get. I don't like to have confrontations, so that's good. A When was the last time you argued with someone? B I can't really remember. So Leslie said there's not very many arguments. Usually I avoid arguments at any cost. A Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? B I don't really feel guilty about anything right now or that I can think of. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. B I can't think of anything right now. A Hmm. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B I really can't think of any decisions that were really hard. I mean, most. It's pretty easy for me to make a decision, so I don't have a family, so if I have to. You know, I had to move to San Francisco for a job once, but since I'm single, I don't really have to consider other people and children and that type of thing. So it kind of makes certain things easier when you don't have other family to consider. A That makes sense. B Yeah. A Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase. B From your memory, an event. Hmm. Well, obviously you don't, you know, the passing of a family member, you know, you wish everybody could be around forever. So I know when my father died, you know, I mean, I wish I would have had him for a lot longer. I mean, he died at the age of 77 and you know, it would have been nice to have him around a little bit more, but, you know, can't control those things. Life has its own way of dealing with that. A There are always trade offs in life, aren't there? B Yes, there are yin and yang. That's ancient philosophy and it really applies. There's pluses and minuses and negatives and positives. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B Well, as I said, my dad's no longer here and my mother and I, you know, we have our differences. I think mothers and daughters always do. My brother and I get along great. I see him a lot. My sister works a lot. I see her and we talk and she's kind of got her own life and her children, I get along great with them. A That's good. B We have a small family. Once again, it's like that's a hard question to answer. There's so many types of kids out there. I think majority of them seem to be pretty well behaved. I mean, there's always going to be children that are kind of out of control, but I don't know, the ones that I've seen recently, they're very well behaved. So can't say much else about that. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Well, I live in an apartment and I don't know if you've ever lived in an apartment, but there's someone that lives above me. I'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet, but they have a habit of, I guess they have lots of energy. They usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes they'll start washing laundry at midnight. And of course the pipes run through the bedroom wall so it sounds like Niagara Falls in there. And so I don't. Yeah, and I need eight hours of sleep and I've only been getting, oh, I'd say like maybe six hours. And then I usually wake up once at night too, because sometimes they'll kind of. Around 2 or 3 in the morning, they'll either walk around or I'll hear something. So I'm not getting a straight eight hours of sleep. And it's definitely. But there's not, like I said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment. You know, I mean, the lady's very quiet. It's just that she has a habit of, you know, taking later showers, washing clothes at night. That's. I can't say anything to her about that. Yeah, but, you know, there's people that are in worse situations, so I don't make a lot out of it, you know, and I just. It's not like every night, but it's, you know, at least twice a week. So I, you know, I've considered maybe sleeping in another room, but for now, you know, that's. I'll deal with it. A So what are you like when you do sleep? B Well, tired. Very tired. And hard to focus, hard to concentrate. It just takes me longer to get things done because I don't have my energy. Also, I haven't been exercising. I normally try to walk about half an hour a day, but the weather has been kind of colder and kind of drearier, so, you know, I'm not as motivated when the weather's kind of blah. So it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep. A How have you been feeling lately? B As I said before, tired. It's a combination of the weather. You know, here in Los Angeles right now, we have been having very gray days. I live very close to the ocean, so the sun doesn't come out that much, so I'm not getting my serotonin. I need that. I'm not getting my eight hours of sleep because whatever. And I think my thyroid is acting up too, so that's kind of creating. I have some vitamin deficiencies, and once the sun comes out, I'm kind of more energetic. It just gives you that more energy. A Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B I'm happy most of the time. I'm a pretty happy person. And I like to be around other people. I mean, of course I like my private time, but I do like being around people quite a bit. So tell me about something you did. A Recently that you really enjoyed. B Hmm. I can't think of anything right now. I mean, I usually enjoy everything I do. There's nothing that stands out more than anything else. A Okay. Is there anything you regret? B No, I never regret anything. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B What advice would I have given? Well, I guess, yeah, I could probably change things around. I think it. Everybody could. I probably would have Had a different college major, you know, it seems like. What else? I probably wouldn't have dated certain men, wasted time with certain people. I don't know. Those are the things that come to mind. Maybe started saving money earlier, you know, those types of things. A But how would your best friend describe you? B Outgoing, lots of fun to be with. Just a good friend to have. People like having me for a friend. I'm loyal, trusting, and I listen. I'm a good listener. I'm very patient as well, so that's good. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Well, number one would be to lose weight, but I think that's a worldwide problem. I mean, there's a lot of food around and temptations, and especially here in America, a lot of us are couch potatoes. We sit in front of our computers. We. You know, it's just easy to. It's so easy to relax, you know, it's hard to get up and move around. You have to talk yourself into it. So the weight gives you more energy, too, if you lose weight. So that's a big thing as well. But that's probably the thing. Just the weight thing. A Yeah, I understand. How would your best friend describe you? B I think you might have asked me that question before, but if you want, I'll repeat it. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm very. Like I said, I'm very loyal. When I tell people I'm going to do something, I do it. Very reliable. I'm warm. I'm very friendly. I'm a great listener. And I've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me. So, like I said, I'm pretty upbeat. You know, I don't let things get me down too much. So. A What are you most proud of in your life? B Hmm. That's a hard question. Can't think. I mean, I'm. Can't think to answer that one. So. A What are some things you like to do for fun? B For fun? Well, I love movies. I could see every movie that they make. I love going out with my friends, shopping, swap meets. My gosh, traveling is great. Road trips. That's kind of, you know, part of it that I mentioned. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Traveling, getting to see different places. The history aspect of it, the foods, enjoying foods in different countries, the architecture. It's just kind of neat to get away and see a completely different place. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B Okay. Well, I've been to a lot of places in Europe. I love Paris. It's such a walking city. You can. Whoever designed that city, I'll tell you. I mean, you can get from one point to another. The subways are great. Each area has its own distinctive kind of. There's the Latin Quarter where the students are. There's another area where, let's say the fashion designers are kind of like our Rodeo Drive here in Beverly Hills, there's an area that is more African and they have swap meets on the weekends that are wonderful. It's very international. And then, like I said, once you get out of Paris, there's just so much history. You can go see Versailles. There's other palaces. You can go to the south of France, but that's probably my favorite country. I've been to Italy as well. A That sounds like a great situation. B Yeah. Well, after college, people usually. I mean, people that go to college or either before or after college, that's a great time to go to Europe because you're young and you're not tied down. You don't have a family, and you kind of have a more adventuresome spirit. You got more energy. So carrying backpack or suitcases is not a big deal. So. Yeah, that's right. A Yeah. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Thank you. Goodbye. A Okay. B Oh, that. That was fast. I didn't. There wasn't. There wasn't any, like, shocking questions. It. A You're expecting worse? B Yeah. A Never know, I guess. Exactly.

"A When she's finished, you can go ahead and let me know. Okay? B Okay. A And she'll let you know. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Um. Pretty good. Kind of, yeah. A Where are you from originally? B Los Angeles. A Really? B Yes. A What are some things you really like about la? B The thing I like about la? The weather. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B It's not easy to meet people. A Can you tell me about that? B Well, it just feels like people aren't out very much. They're like that movie in Crash where people are just in their cars all the time. It feels like that. A Yeah, I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B No, not too much. A Okay. What did you study at school? B Child development. A How did you decide to do that? B Well, I have a son and I wanted to know how to be a good mom. And so I wanted to know about the stages that he would be going through and be able to relate better to him. A That's great. Are you happy you did that? B I am. A Are you still doing that? B Kind of. I'm trying to get it started again in the fall. A I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? B I'd like to write. A Nice. Tell me about that. B Well, I've written some children's books and I've just been doing research, looking into getting my books published. It's only like two that I've written so far, but they're pretty good. I've gotten some good feedback on them from my critique groups. A What was it about? B It's about a little boy that's surrounded by people that are jerks and he tries to not become a jerk with him. And it fits a bit like a really. He goes through a lot of moods dealing with the people in his life. A Awesome. Do you find it easy to be a parent? B No. I've had some issues, some nervous breakdowns, actually. And right now my son is staying with his dad. Same. So, no. I was single Mom. It was the hardest thing, I think, in the world is being a single Mom. A Yeah. B So. A How do you cope with them? B How do I cope? Well, right now I didn't have very many coping skills or mechanisms, so that was the problem. A What's the best thing about being a parent? B It's so spontaneous. Like the stuff that comes out of kids mouth sometimes and the stuff that they do and just brings a smile to your face. A Can you give me an example of that? B Well, when my son was younger once, we were just sitting around the house and he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me, mom, I want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend. So, yeah, pretty spontaneous things like that happen that my kids telling me I need to not be single anymore. A Okay. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? B The hardest thing? Not wanting to screw it up. I feel a lot of stress and pressure that every little thing is going to make a difference and matter and what kind of person my kid turns out to be. And so it's a lot of stress on yourself. Yeah. A Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? B Yeah, definitely. A What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? B I think I'm different from my mom because I'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction. I welcome it, you know, I welcome getting to know who my child is right now and not try to mold them into somebody that I want them to be, but just see them become the best child that they can be, the best adult that they can be without molding them in that direction necessarily into a different person. A Uhhuh. So who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Say it again. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Who's someone that's a positive influence? A Yeah. B I don't really have anybody like that. A Okay. B Okay. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B Well, I've tried to meditate sometimes, but I don't really stick with it often enough. I've tried to like, go for walks, but I don't always do that and I don't always stick with it. So yeah, that's about it. A How are you at controlling your temper? B I'd say I'm a little below average. Meaning that I get angry more than most people do. I think when was the last time. A You argued with someone and what was it about? B Hmm. Last night it was on the telephone. I was arguing with my husband. We have. My sister lives with us, and she lives with us in a very small room with a small apartment, I should say. And she's got four people living in one room. So it's kind of stressful. It's really crowded, and my husband is stressed out about it. And, you know, I'm just saying to him that I told you so. I told you if my sister moved in here, then there was going to be a mess in the house, and she's going to be asking for things she don't really want to do. That's just how my sister is. So the house is messy and it's crowded, and every day they're asking for rides. And my husband, he's avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't want to be there anymore. And I'm just saying that he's going to have to find a way to deal with it because he asked for it, in my opinion. So. A That sucks. B It does. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Oh, I've got tons of them. But right now, what's on my mind is losing custody of my son right now. Like, I've been arguing with my stepmom and my stepsister for a long time about my son and how they treat him and how I want him to be treated. Like, they don't have any boundaries. And I believe that boundaries are important, establishing who's the adult, who's the child. They let my child blossom around and stuff. Anyways, because of this, they're going to be testifying against me in the custody trial, saying that, yeah, they're going to be saying that I'm not a good mom because I believe in having boundaries. And we have very different ideas about child raising. She's my stepmom. She's my dad's fifth wife, and she's. She really does it. She's really far removed from how I was raised. And I want to raise my child more similar to how I was raised, where we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us. And with my stepmom, she makes no rules. She has no expectations. She just wants him to run wild and have everything that he wants. And that's fine when you're a grandparent, but the problem is that I live with them sometimes. And when I'm in the same House with them. They should be following my rules and not trying to go and break all of my rules anyway. A That makes sense. B Yeah. A In that moment. B In that moment, just really frustrated because they don't listen to me. I feel disrespected. I feel, like, invisible. I feel just angry that they're taking away my right to parent. And it's something that I worked really hard to do. I went to school and I studied child development. I read all the magazines, and I've read the books, and I really. I know what I'm talking about. I feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities. And to have these people that haven't done the same thing and worked as hard as I have to be a good parent try and tell me that I'm a bad parent, it's really hard to believe. So I feel very disrespected, unacknowledged, angry, frustrated, all those things. A Yeah. I'm sorry. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B I take Benadryl to help me sleep, and I'm so. My doctor gave me that. She gave me Benadryl, told me I could take it to help me sleep. Last night, I was crying before I went to sleep. So sometimes these thoughts start running through your head at night when you're in bed. But I tried to push them out, and then I got up and I took my Benadryl so I could go to sleep more easily. A Are they triggered by something? B Yeah. I'm always thinking about my son. Oh, I wish he was with me and how unfair everything is that's happening, and, like, I don't deserve to have my son taken from me because I'm a really good mom, you know, And I'm too hard on myself, so. But I am a good mom. And I feel confident that I'm a good mom or just. I don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad. The son's dad, does. He has more money than me. And right now I'm trying to be okay with it because I know he can do more for him financially than I could. But that doesn't mean I'm not a good mom. A How have you been feeling lately? B I'm pretty depressed. I'm on antidepressants. Take Wellbutrin. I've been on them for a couple weeks now. I think they're working. I don't know. I'm not as down as I was. I mean, I got here today, I got dressed, and I made it out And I'm here today, so not that bad. A What got you to seek help? B Um. Hmm. My husband complains a lot. He says I'm not the same person that I was when he married me. He said I was fun and I was positive and there was all these other optimistic things. That's another thing he was on the phone telling me last night and. And I'm not those things anymore, which is true. I mean, we got married a year ago, and then my son was taken shortly after and. And it was just such a shock. And I've just been trying to get back from it, but it's been hard. A I understand. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? B Did I think I had a problem before I found out? Found out what? Oh, yeah. I like crying a lot sometimes. Like, I cry all the time. It doesn't take much for me to cry. I'm just crying, thinking about crying. But, like, my family would invite me to family events and I would go and just. Just cry because my son wasn't there or. I don't know. It's just all the crying, I think. And like I said, my husband letting me know that I'm not the same. So he's disappointed and I feel bad even that I'm not the same person that he knew. I feel bad about that too. Another thing I'm feeling bad about, you know. A Do you still go to therapy now? B Yes, I do. I try. A Do you feel like therapy is useful? B Do I feel like the therapy is useful? Yeah. It's nice to talk about your problems. I go in there and I cry every week. So at least I have a set time every week where I can go in and cry. That's. I mean, it's a release to be able to cry. Sometimes I feel better afterwards. Yeah. And she helps me make decisions, you know, help me to be more proactive in my life. A Like what? B Well, I'm looking for jobs and things like that. And she gives me ideas of why don't you work here, why don't you work there? Have you thought about this or that? You know, and then she said something about, why don't you go back to school? And so I went and applied to go back to school. You know, I'm not doing much with my life and sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either. So I'm trying to find a work. And I applied for college in the fall. I got accepted to Dominguez Hills, so I may be going back to school in the fall right now. I'M still looking for work, but she helps me with that kind of stuff. Just giving me ideas that life isn't over, that there's still more, you know, I could be doing with life. Life. Yeah. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Everything's always bittersweet. I don't know. Last time I was really happy. I don't know. A Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B My ideal weekend? Oh, I don't have a lot of money because I'm not working right now. So really my weekends are just spent reading. Maybe, but I can't really. I can't pay much attention when I'm reading, so I have a short attention span. I can only read a couple chapters, but lately I say that's what I've been doing, is reading. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Something I read. Okay. I like to go to usc. They have these nights where they have things like book signings or poetry and art. It's called Visions and Voices. So I like to go out to their events and I usually enjoy those. A Awesome. When was the last time that happened? B About two weeks ago. Deborah Harkness was there doing a book signing for a Discovery of Witches. So, like I said, I'm trying to be a writer. So I try to go especially to the book signings and see what it's like to be an author who's talking to a crowd and signing books. A What are you most proud of in your life. B My son? A How do your best friend describe you? B I don't have many friends. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B My best qualities? I'm smart, I'm good looking. I'm really. I like a hard worker. I'm dedicated to, like, self improvement. That's all I can think of right now. Okay. A Okay. I think I've asked everything. I need you. Thanks. Sharing your thoughts with me.

"A All right. All right, so now I'm going to hand. I'm going to put the doorbell right over here. B Okay? Alrighty. Thank. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm okay. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B Los Angeles. A Really? What are some things you really like about la? B I don't know. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B It's kind of dirty, but. But it's to be expected from a big city. A Yeah. What did you study at school? B The last class that I took was a sociology class. I'm not really sure where I'm going with school, but I'm thinking about sex education. A How did you decide to do that? B I think that it's a really important job. I feel like. Because there's kind of a stigma, I guess, about talking about sex. It leads to, like, a lot of unsafe sex and a lot of unplanned pregnancies. So I feel like it's a very important job for the world. A How hard is that? B I don't know. A Okay. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B No. A Why? B Lack of funds. A I see what you mean. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B It depends on the people. But I'd say that generally I'm more shy. Of course, with people who I know well, like, who are closer to me, I'm more outgoing. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B Play with my dogs. I don't know. If it's a nice day, I'll go for a walk. If it's not a nice day or if it's cold out or something, then maybe watch a show on TV I like, or read a book or something. A How are you at controlling your temper? B I'd say I'm pretty good at controlling my temperature. A That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? B Um. I can't remember. I think the last person I argued with was My boyfriend, probably last week. But I don't even remember what it was about. A Okay, what's something you feel guilty about? B Um, I don't think I really feel guilty about anything. I'd say that I regret things, but I think there's a difference between guilt and regret. Like, I think guilt is more just like feeling bad, but regret is like feeling like you should have made a different decision. And I think that can help you to make better decisions in the future. Whereas guilt, you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless. A Is there anything to regret? B I regret not doing better when I was in high school. I mean, not getting better grades. I regret, like, getting involved with certain people in the past. But I mean, I'm not sure that's about it that I can think of right now. A Could you have done anything to avoid it? B Hmm? A Could you have done anything to avoid it? B Yeah. I mean. I mean, in the past, yeah, I could have made different decisions. I mean, obviously some things, you know, aren't entirely in your control. But I'm not going to feel. I'm not going to regret things that I had no power over. So. A Tell me about Nevette or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B I'm not sure if I would want to erase it from my memory, but I wish that it didn't happen to me. Was a time that I was raped. A I'm sorry to hear that. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B I can't really think of any hard decisions. I can't think of any. A Okay, tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Hmm. I'm not sure. I can't think of any. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B I have a pretty good relationship with my family. I wouldn't say that I'm really close with my mother, but I mean, we get along well and I'm very close with my sister. We're basically best friends. A That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Um. Hmm. I think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life because she was always able to provide for me and she always. She didn't. I mean, she made like, mistakes sometimes, but I think that she was always there for me when I needed it and she just did her best to raise me. So I think she was a big positive influence. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B It's been easy lately. Sometimes I have trouble sleeping, but Lately, I have had no problems. A What are you, like when you don't sleep? Well. B It depends how long I've gone without sleep. I can just be anywhere from, like, groggy to, like, really on edge and, like, extremely tired. I don't know. A Okay. How have you been feeling lately? B I have been feeling pretty good. I have, like, general anxiety kind of all the time, but it's not as bad as it has been in the past. So I've been feeling mostly pretty good. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B I think that I've actually been feeling happier lately. I wouldn't say that I'm like, really happy all the time. I'm mostly just kind of like neutral. But I have been feeling more positive lately. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B I'm actually not sure if I have been diagnosed with ptsd. A Can you tell me about that? B I know I've been seeing psychologists for, like, since I was 16 for depression. And I think my first psychologist, who I saw for a few years thought that I had ptsd, but I'm not sure if she ever made a diagnosis. A Did you think you had a problem before you found out? B Um, I'm not sure. A What were your symptoms? B Uh, I. I don't. A Is going to a therapist helping you? B Yes. A How has seeing a therapist affected you? B It's helpful to talk someone and have them kind of guide you in talking about something so that you can figure things the way. Figure out your feelings about things, sort of, I guess, for yourself or like why it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why you're feeling a certain way about something. I mean, I think sometimes you can do that on your own, but talking to somebody helps, I think. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Um. Hmm. I'm not sure. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Um, I'm not sure. A Okay. How would your best friend describe you? B Um, I'm not sure. A Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B Uh, I think I would spend it mostly at home, but it would be sunny out and I would go outside a little bit and I'd play with my dogs and I'd probably have my boyfriend over. I'd eat food that I like. Like, only food that I like. Like my favorite foods, watch movie or TV show that I like. Just kind of have like a relaxing time. But that's nice. A What advice would you give yourself? 10 or 20 years ago? B I would tell myself to. To do better in school, because throughout high school I was kind of an underachiever. And I ended up going to community college, like, on and off because I would like, sort of lose interest and then not do well or as well as I could have. So I would tell myself to do as well as I could in school because I feel like I am capable of a lot more than I do. And I think I could easily have gotten a scholarship if I had done well in high school. So I would just tell myself, did you get in school? And probably warned myself about one or two people that turned out to be not worth my time. A What are you most proud of in your life? B I think I proud of myself for not being bitter and for wanting to. Well, I am kind of bitter, yes. But I guess I'm proud of myself for not being selfish and wanting to make the world a better place. Like, because a lot of bad things have happened to me and I try to instead. Instead of dwell on them, I try to or I want to be able to make things better for other people and as much as I want to help, I guess, empower people to make their lives better. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.

D Okay. C Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? A No. C Do you feel down? A Sometimes. C Can you tell me about that? A What do you want to know? Well, I think sometimes I do think about challenges ahead of me, and that can be a little daunting. And I feel down. C That sounds really hard. A It is very hard. C How do you cope with them? A Go for a walk, read a book, listen to some music? I don't. I mean, I'm sure they are. I'm not specifically sure what triggers anything.

So she's going to chat with you for a bit and then I'm going to give you the doorbell. So when she's done talking, she'll let you know and you can ring the doorbell. C Okay, thank you. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. C Okay. B Ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? C Yes. B Okay. So how are you doing today? C Pretty good. A little tired. B That's good. Where are you from originally? C Seattle, Washington. B Why'd you move to LA? C When I was 18, my mom and dad decided we wanted to move to California and so we moved down to Pasadena. Actually Monrovia first. And I've been here ever since. Yeah. B How often do you go back to your hometown? C I did about two years ago. I went up for work and look around the area. B Nice. How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? C Pretty easy, actually. I do adapt. B That's good. What are some things you really like about la? C The warm weather, not having rain nine months of the year. People mainly. B What are some things you don't really like about la? C The area, how big it is, the traffic when I first got here, the smog. That's better. Now. B Do you consider yourself an introvert? C No. When I was younger I was. But I got out of that with work. I did, sure. When I became. When my mom died and I needed work, I went for a job that was called petitioning. And you have to go in front of stores and talk to people about signing petitions. And you do that after a while. You don't get shy about talking to anybody. Also, when I was in school, I took public speaking and I learned that I really liked it more than I thought I would. So I did the census job. I actually got up in front of groups of people and talked to them and showed them how to take the test, and I enjoyed it. Right now I'm working on getting all my licenses for selling insurance and I'm going to start work trying to get money from people to help kids in the world. B How did you decide to do that? C Well, the one. The job helping kids was also a paid job and I needed a paid job. The one for insurance was I was getting older and I needed work that was steady. And that's something I can do till I'm 85 or 90 or whatever. B What's your dream job? C To be an artist. B Really? Tell me more about that. C Well, I've always been good with art. I like drawing, painting, etc. But I didn't know if I could ever make a living in it. So I never really got into it. And every time I tried, it seemed I never got anywhere. So maybe when I get like 80 or 90, maybe I'll go into the ceramics or something and do that as a profession. B Do you travel a lot? C No, unfortunately I don't. That's okay. B How close are you to your family? C I'm not. My mom and dad are dead. I have no brothers or sisters and the rest of my family have either moved away or. Or I don't talk to them anymore or. Like that. B That sounds really hard. C I have kind of an attitude that if I have me and friends I have that I'm okay. B Okay. What do you do to relax? C Read, watch sports when they're available. I used to play golf. I may do that again someday, but not right now because of the cost and the time. B Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? C People that are rude. B What do you do when you're annoyed? C I usually ignore it. This morning, actually, I told a guy to stop what he was doing and we got kind of an argument about it. And then the argument was over and it was done. B How are you at controlling your temper? C Very good, because I had a very bad temper when I was a kid and I told myself I had to control it. B When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? C This morning? About the guy making lots and lots of noise on purpose and in a place that was just not the place to do it. I mean, it was a public place, but. And that was it. Just a little argument. And I'm done with the argument. Once I say what I say yes. Not right now, that I can think of. B What are some things you like to do for fun. C Like read. If I can travel, I travel. I don't travel long distances, but even going out the riverside is kind of an adventure for me. B What do you enjoy about traveling? C Seeing things on the way and back. Talking to people maybe. B That's great. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. C Well, a number of years ago I drove back east to Massachusetts to do work back there. On the way back I took a Greyhound bus all the way back from Washington D.C. all the way back to California into Washington first and then down from there and worked in Massachusetts for about six months to eight months. Enjoyed the area quite a bit, but didn't want to be there when the snow came and enjoyed coming back on the bus. Had people next to me almost all the way. Different people and had a lot of fun. Yeah, Yeah. I was in the Air Force when I was 18, 1965 during the Vietnam War. B Did you ever see combat? C No, I was in Great Falls, Montana. B How did serving in the military change you? C It really didn't. Years later I probably learned more from the fact that I got out early and maybe I should have stayed in and stuck with it. I tended to quit things when I was younger and so now with that and other things, I decide never to quit anything. B What did you do after the military? C I came down here, played pool for a number of years. Finally graduated from high school, which I dropped out of when I moved. Went on to college, got my bachelor's degree and an AA degree at Pasadena and Cal State la, and started working various jobs and that's about it. Took care of my mom. Business was my major. I also studied things like anthropology and philosophy and history, etc. B Awesome. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? C No. B Have you been diagnosed with depression? C No, never do. B How easy is it for you to. C Get a good night's sleep lately? Not so good. Between the fact that I sleep in my car and it's very cold and that sometimes I do get. And with all the things going on in my life right now, I think of things and plus I get up at 4:30 in the morning. That's okay. I'm tired and I get a little grumpy sometimes, but not very much tired with all the things I've had to do and the weather and the sleep. B Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? C No. Do you feel down a little bit sometimes about how maybe I should have started doing all this years ago? B How do you cope with them? C I just go on. I tell myself to basically stop it and go on doing things to improve myself. B How hard is that? C Not very anymore. It took me years to study that, to do that. I don't know if you call it Zen or not, but a couple months ago, when I passed all my tests and Medicare Advantage passed every one of them for every company that sent them to me. B That's great. What would you say are some of your best qualities? C I stick to everything I do now. I'm persistent. I don't let things get out of hand before I do something about it. I used to be. What's the word? I put off things. I don't do that anymore. And I treat people nicely always until given a reason not to. And I don't talk about my bad stuff to anybody, usually. B How hard is that? C Not very, because the same thing I've trained myself over the years to not talk about myself. I talk to other people. I talk about them. B Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? C Let's see, my mother, Gandhi, Bertrand Russell. Let's see. I'm not sure who else other people I've had, but I don't remember their names or they were teachers, etc. Earlier in life, like I said, stopping everything, not completing things that I regret very much. B Could you have done anything to avoid it? C Yeah, I could have done better. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? C Probably the advice I gave myself to get off my butt and go learn, get an education and get on with my life and do something. B What are you most proud of in your life? C I've survived. B Okay. Can you tell me about that? C Well, I'm 65. I've been sleeping in my car for a number of years. I went from sleeping on pavement to where I got a car. While I've done that, I've improved my credit rating. I've gotten a number of jobs that I've been very happy with. I've had a lot of friends, both people that are homeless and non homeless, and I'm in pretty good health, whereas other people in my family have died young. So I guess that's about it. B Okay, what are some things that usually put you in a good mood? C Good jokes, people having a happy time, going to having a drink with somebody on an occasional basis. B When was the last time that happened? C About eight months ago was the last time I went and had a beer with someone. Let's see, probably getting within one foot of a live wild deer. It was in Green Lake in Washington and I was out behind our house and this wild buck deer was walking in the field, and I started motioning to it, and it came within about one foot of me. And. And the only reason it left, my dad drove down the driveway and it made noise and the deer ran off. I was within petting distance of him, and I wasn't too sure if I should have petted him or not. But I was about to. B Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. C Thank you. Bye. She's pretty cool for a knot.

"So now I'm going to draw our virtual human. You can see what it looks like. I'm going to go ahead and start the camera recording here. All right. And I'm going to go ahead and start it. And again, when she says goodbye, just press this button. I will come back for you. Hi. B Salut, Ellie. Hi, Ellie. A thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started and do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B pretty well. And you? Where are you from? What are the things you really like? Well, seeing that I do not live in Los Angeles, I live in Long Beach. I like the fact that there are a lot of activity and many more people, but generally I am a type of person in small town. What are the things you don't really like at it? B Crime, overcrowding, cost of living. R I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? B as much as possible. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B It's really difficult to say. I had a lot of good experiences in the army, many good experiences in my marriage. Different traveling places, camping, raising children. These are all good things. What did you study at school? B School, social services. What are you doing now? B for the moment, I am disabled and I hope I start again at school in the fall. A good. What is your dream work? B My dream work is to be a chemical dependence advisor. Do you consider yourself more shy or out? B I would just say it depends on the circumstances. Sometimes I can be quite withdrawn, other times I am really out. I guess it depends on time. One why? B Sometimes I really thought or that something happens internally, so I don't really say much. I am more attentive at that time. Then, when I think there is something that must be said, I am not afraid to say it. A Tell Me on your relationship with your family. B I have a very good relationship with my family. We all speak every week. I come from a big family, I have many brothers and sisters. My mother and father still live, so I'm talking to them. My mother does not live too far from me. My father lives. I have two older brothers to whom I speak regularly and my younger sisters I speak to many nieces and nephews. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fish screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I listen to classical music. Read something. Maybe watch a movie. It is a good escape. Read something. I am involved in anonymous alcoholics. I could go to a meeting that helps me interact with others. How are you going to control your temperament? B pretty well. I rarely have an explosion. I am a calm person. My behavior sometimes says to people the opposite, but I am a really calm person. People say that I look mean, but I'm not. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B It's really difficult to say. It's probably just a disagreement with the way someone was treated. I'm really. It really bothers me when someone is mistreated and I don't even really know. I couldn't even emphasize it, but I know that is probably what it was. To tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B The first thing that comes to mind is when my marriage broke. I would have liked to accept it much earlier than me and I continued in my life. But it took. I had been. I had been married for more than 20 years and it was difficult for me to accept. To accept the fact that my wife wanted to divorce and that I tried to hang much longer and that I have just used and mistreated. So I want me to have just seized this situation and that I went much faster. At uh huh. What do you feel guilty? B That when my wife and I welcomed our granddaughters and I promised to raise them and see them through their education, that I did not have the opportunity to do so. A large part was my fault and I feel guilty about it. To Tell Me on the most difficult decision you have ever had. Had to do. B well, it comes to acceptance of accepting the end of my marriage. It was the same. It was the most difficult decision, it was when I finally decided to stop fighting what was going to happen and going ahead. A good, tell me about an event or something you want to be able to erase from your memory. B HMM. I would say that I probably wouldn't want to erase anything from my memory because I grew up and learned from each experience I have ever had in my life. So I wouldn't say that I want to erase anything. These are the things that make me what I am today. And I love myself today. Have you ever served in the army? B yes, I have. I am a UN veteran States army. At what age were you when you joined the army? B I was 19 years old. Why did you decide? B Well, initially the idea of ​​having money at university, which I was very motivated to go to university, having this money to finance my college studies was very appetizing. And also I felt like I needed a break in academics, but I knew I wanted to start again at some point. But that didn't happen. You know, life has occurred. I got married and da da da da. So I always try to finish college studies now at 47 years old. So, almost 30 years have passed, but I will get it. Are you happy that you did that? B yes. It is the best experience. The best thing I have ever done for me was to join the army. I always pay dividends. It's my life today. Helps me pay my bills today. My pension that I receive I learned a lot. I have to learn, meet people from all over the country, see places that I had never seen before. Gave me a lot of opportunities. Have you ever seen fights? B No, I didn't do it. A I am sorry. How easy for you to go back to civilian life? B It's a bit difficult, you know, when you serve your country, you get used to it and have a place to be every day. And all of a sudden, you are essentially free and no longer have this discipline in your life. It is therefore difficult to readjust. I think it took me a long time, longer than I thought. A it's great. What did you do after the min. Military? B See, I was a security guard. I worked in the bakery in a Safeway store. Then I installed carpets and floor coverings for about 10 years or better. Worked in retail, just a lot of different jobs. How did the army service change you? B It gave me a lot of self -confidence. I have never been very athletic, but it is the most physical activity I have ever had. I developed my body, developed my mind, shown how much mental courage I had. Did me on a lot. Showed me a lot of strength about me. A it's great. How do you feel recently? B recently, I felt pretty good. It's going pretty well. I was very. Much more active than me. I'm looking for an apartment right now. Get out of my current life situation. It's very exciting. I'm just more active in my daily life. Have you noticed these last changes lately? B just in the same direction. I seem to be a little happier. Depression is not too massively. I still have b The days of announcements, but I take my medication and I go to my advice and everything seems to work well. R I'm sorry to hear that. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B is very difficult. I throw and turn around, I have fleece night sweaters, probably having nightmares that I do not remember. I wake up several times. How are you when you don't sleep well? B In fact, I'm much more. I am too energetic. Adrenaline takes over and I cross my day. So I am. Then at the end of the day, I am exhausted, but it makes it more difficult to sleep again. So it's just a continuous vicious circle. So I don't know what to do on this subject. I speak to my doctors and they don't want to put too much sleep drugs. So I try to have a good night's sleep and take as much rest as possible. Try not to take a nap during the day, let's hope it better during the night. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B yes. How long have you been diagnosed? B It's been over 10 years, probably longer than that. I don't remember the exact date. What were your symptoms? B anger, nightmares, agitation. I do not remember everything they said because I have a lot of overlapping problems. So you know, anxiety. Are they triggered by something? B not that I know. By telling me more about it. B well, I really don't know what to say. I guess I should get one. How do you face them? B I talk about it when I feel depressed. I speak to people, I go out and I do things and I help someone else get out of oneself and be at the service of others. If I remove it from yourself, it's very useful. A it's good. What made you ask for help? B well, what brought me, what made me get the help was that I am an alcoholic and I drank and I wanted to stop drinking. And then I had to discover the reasons I drank and, you know, I was drinking alcohol as. Also to oneself. Drug for different problems. And I had to get away from alcohol and other substances, you know, other drugs. And once I did this, I could. I had professionals who were more able to differentiate themselves with the alcohol problems of other problems and to prescribe the right medications, to prescribe the right type of treatment. You know, group therapy, individual therapy. These things were very useful. A good. Are you still in therapy now? B Yes, I do it. Yes I do it. I have group therapy five days a week and individual therapy once a week. A good. Do you think therapy is useful? B As catharsis, I am able to take my old heavy luggage and leave it somewhere and not wear it. You know, it is as if I had this big ball above my head which is filled with all my negative thoughts, my negative situations, my negative thoughts, everything. And every time I am in therapy or I am in an AA meeting or that I empty this ball and I don't have to wear such a burden. I can leave these luggage, these garbage elsewhere and not have to transport it and be a burden for myself. It is therefore very useful. Can you tell me? B I'm just. It's just a great way to get rid of bad feelings. What changes have you noticed since you have been in therapy? B I'm not so depressed. I am much more out. I still have a long way to go. I don't know. My feelings of indignity are limited. They are still there. But I feel better in my skin, that I love me better today than me, let's say, two years ago. So there is. There is hope. R when is the last time you felt really happy? B HMM. I can't say. It's a bit ephemeral. I don't know I'm never really super delighted. Everything is always so suffocated for me. I don't think it's really just joy, joy, joy. A it's great. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B first, my father. He's a good man. My mother, my older brothers. They are excellent. How would your best friend describe you? B I don't really know that I have a best friend. I know I have friends. What about something that you recently did that you really enjoyed? Good. B I went to a baseball match on a Sunday, I went to the California Angels, I played the Oakland A, I went to a baseball match with a sober group and I went out and ate hot dogs and nachos and drank Pepsi and enjoyed a nice baseball match on Sunday afternoon. It was really a good time. What are you most proud of in your life? B I would say my granddaughters. I have no biological children, but I have a daughter-in-law, then her children and they all call me. And so even if my wife and I are not together. I am always an active part of their lives and I am very proud of them. A it's great. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. B Okay, thank you. A farewell. B Goodbye. R and you are free, you know, get up and move if you wish. But I'm going to go ahead and get out in a second because I want to make sure. Save. And no W You've all finished.

"A All right, so let's see. Move this around and I'm gonna. I probably would put the chair in the wrong place, so I'm just gonna have you scoot back just a tad, if you don't mind. B Like that? A Yeah. Cuz we want to see your hands. Okay, perfect. I think that looks good. B Okay. A All right. B I know it's a little. She look all weird. She look real, though. A Oh, good. All right, so now she's gonna chat with you for a little bit. I'm gonna give you the doorbell. I'm gonna put it right here. B Also, just talk to her about anything. Okay, that sounds like. A When she's done, she'll let you know. Okay. B And then. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm fine. Today. Today's my daughter's birthday. A Aw, that's great. B Where are you from originally? California. A Really? B Yes. A What are some things you really like about la? B The beach. I love the waters. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B The gang violence. Violence? A Can you tell me about that? B I lost a lot of friends growing up in. Through elementary and high school. Just losing them through gang violence. A Sorry to hear that. B Yeah, thank you. This is pretty tough out there. A Yeah, I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B Haven't been to any place out of California yet, so not really. A Okay. What do you study at school? B I'm an optician. I'm a certified optician and I also have my associate's degree. A That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? B Actually, I went in. I didn't really know what I wanted to do when I first applied. I just knew I wanted to change my life and do something successful before I settled down and now have my daughter and everything. Actually, my guidance counselor kind of helped me. And I always thought like, they were so cool because they're white, long lab coats. A What's your dream job? B To be an optometrist. A Why? B Because I'm already an optician and that's like the first step. And why it was a good question. Is because then I would have be able to have My own business and I would have something successful to leave to my daughter and she wouldn't have to really want for anything. It would be like a family business, but to help the community as well and something I can leave for my daughter. A That makes sense. Tell me about your kids. B My daughter, she's five years old. She'll be starting elementary school next week and today is her birthday. Five years ago I had her. She is very smart. I taught her home. I home schooled her for five years. And she's adorable. She's my heart. A Do you find it easy to be a parent? B No. This is like the hardest job ever. It's very hard providing. Providing. Making sure that you wash their clothes because, I mean, it's hard enough to be a parent. But I'm a young parent and I'm a little more mature than her father. So it's. It's the providing part. I would basically say making sure that you have everything that they need. It's so complicated, let alone it gives you enthusiasm to be more. To go the extra mile. Me even being here today, I probably would have still been in bed, but today's my daughter's party and I was trying to make whatever extra little money I could make, you know, to make sure that she has a good day. So it's all about going that extra mile, doing anything that you can do to provide for them. But it's a very hard job. A What's the best thing about being a parent? B That moment of the day when your child tells you how much they care about you. And my daughter, her favorite thing to tell me is I'm her heart, you know, and when they call your name, it's a sense of reality. So we called mom or we called dad, and it's just like it infatuates you. It also lets you know, like, this is reality. This is my life. This is what I'm living right now. And it's a very good feeling. That's the best part of being a parent. A That's so good to hear. B Thank you. A What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? B A lot of different things. I'm actually taking care of my daughter. I'm here with her. I was raised by my grandparents, so I mean, I didn't really. I didn't get to know my mom until I was 16. And my father, I mean, I couldn't point him out or the street on the sidewalk, so I don't know who he is. So I feel that I'm very different from Them because no matter how hard the job is getting, I don't give up. A Yeah. B Yeah. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B I would say there's been. Excuse me. There's been a lot of different people that have been very positive in my life. I can say my sister. She was a good influence on me to get into the medical field. She's an lvn and she's one of my older sisters. I can say me believing in God, being in my life. God being in my life has also kept me strong. And to know that I don't have to take on this world by myself because God is there for me. And I don't know. I don't really look up to a lot of different people because people lie. So that's the most I can think that's been positive for me. A Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I think I'm outgoing. I used to be shy coming up as a kid, and I don't know. I don't know what happened to me. One day I just broke out of my shell and I've been very accurate of showing my personality off. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I actually like for the waves to collapse against the rocks and at the beach. And I would like to just sit there and just zone everybody else out that's there and rub my toes in the sand, and that is so relaxing. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Excuse me. Sorry about that. I learned that because it's a form of knowing who's in control and is it your life or is it someone else's? And I feel that my temper, me controlling my temper is showing that I'm in charge of my life. So I don't even let stuff get to me. I don't even really remember the last time that I had to control my temper because that's how much I try to block out the negativity. A That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Probably my husband, my daughter's father, probably over, like, oh, you know, the dishes are like the small things, but not a physical altercation like with another human. Me? A No. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? B Wow. Being honest, I kind of feel guilty about how things, like, basically how things ended before my mom passed. I wish that I could have helped her a Little more. Even though people told me not to feel bad because she wasn't really there for me growing up. But I kind of felt guilty, like, you know, not being there as much as I could have been for her before she passed away. So I think that's something that I still feel guilty for. A Okay, tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Going through my mom passing away. A How did you feel in that moment? B I felt like. I felt like basically that it was. I felt kind of robbed in a sense. Like I felt everyone else had parents and I grew up with my grandparents. And then for me to go so many years without actual mom and dad, for me to get 18 years old and then she leaves me, it was kind of like, I don't know, it was nerve wracking because I felt robbed, you know, it was like I didn't have her all these years, and then now that I'm older and I don't even have her now. So. A Yeah. I'm sorry. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Um, signing the paper of having a C section when it was time for me to have my daughter. I was so nervous, so scared. Really didn't know what to do, how to take it. And I mean, like, that was so scary. A What made you decide to do that? B It was the safest way of bringing my daughter into this world. A Are you happy you did that? B Yes. A That's good. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B It's hard. I didn't even sleep last night. That's why I'm yarning. But I kind of tend to try to do everything and I have to get back to that stage where I have to think about myself as well, give myself time. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B A little like this. But actually, I'm a little nicer today. Just groggy. A Okay. How have you been feeling lately? B Lately I've been feeling very confident about being positive about going the extra mile of being a good parent. A That's great. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughtfully? B Uh, yeah. I actually really don't care what other people think anymore. I used to let that bother me. I don't no more. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Oh, today. Because I was so happy that I brought my daughter into this world today on her birthday. A Huh. What would you say are some of your best qualities? B Getting to know people. A Is there anything you regret? B Not the moment. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B I go to watch who I associate with. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B My weight. A Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. B Um. I was with my grandma. A Can you tell me about that? B Mm. Well, I'd rather not. A Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? B My daughter. It's my pride and joy. A That's great. Okay. I think I lost everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Wow. Thank you. A Goodbye. B Bye. This is cool. I need to take her home. Let's say save this.

"A Okay, now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit and when she's done, she'll let you know. I'll put the doorbell over here. You can let me know when she's finished, okay? B Okay, thank you. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Um, I'm okay. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B I was born in San Bernardino, California. A Really? B Yes, I'm staying with a sister in North Hollywood. She makes it as comfortable as possible. A Okay. Where's the things you really like about la? B I love the weather and the entertainment and the public transportation. It's very difficult to find full time employment and some of the people aren't as friendly as people from the south. Cuz I lived in the south before. Those are the only two things. A Do you travel a lot? B No, I don't. A What you study at school? B I was an English major in college. A Are you still working in that? B I haven't finished. Yes, I am. A What do your dream job? B I'd like to be a recording singer. A Really? B Yes. A What made you decide to do that? B I've always loved to sing from the time that I was a child. A Do you consider yourself an introvert? B At times? A Can you tell me about that? B When I'm alone, I am extremely, I guess I would say interminded. Like I have a lot of thoughts and I keep them to myself. So if I'm in that mode then I don't really interact with people. But I can also interact with people if I change modes. I've just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago and last week? On Thursday? No, on Tuesday. A What do you do when you're annoyed? B Usually I just try to remain quiet, listen to the situation, if it's a person or if it's a situation that I'm dealing with myself. That's annoying. I try to think of alternate ways that would make the situation better. Come up with alternate plans so I won't be annoyed. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Pretty good. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B I may have had an argument a few weeks ago, just about Timeliness, like meeting on time and showing up on time. And it was actually last Monday. No. To just be cautious of people's intentions and to listen really well, because people usually tell you what their intentions are without even realizing it. A good listener, patient, fun loving, generous, depressed sometimes, but generally a good person. No, I have not. Yes, within a year and a half ago, I just knew that I often thought about situations that happened in the past and kind of blamed the situation for my future. And often certain settings. If I see certain types of individuals in certain settings, it just reminds me of when I was younger, when things happened and changed my future plans. So I try to. I used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time. But now I feel like I just handle things better. As far as being in the similar settings with similar people. I just. I handle those things better. A Do you still go to therapy now? B I do. A Is going to a therapist helping you? B I'd like to believe that it does. I don't worry as much. A How has seeing a therapist affected you? B It's just allowed me to know that actually speaking about the issues relieves me of the tension of holding them inside. So that's how it's helped me. At first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions, but now it's. It actually is good because I know that when things are occurring, if I'm able to communicate about them with a certain individual, it relieves me of the stress of trying to figure out everything alone. And oftentimes, by speaking about the issues, it allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be better. Just because I'm hearing myself speak of the issue. I was diagnosed with depression, and my doctor felt that I should probably see the therap. A Are you happy you did that? B I am. A Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B It depends. If I'm really busy during the week and have a lot of things to do, I often try to plan things. And if I am planning things, it affects my sleep. I might wake up in the middle of the night. So sometimes it's easy and sometimes it isn't irritable, just very irritable. I was feeling anxious, but now I'm calmer. Do you feel down today? I don't, but I have in the past week because I was in the midst of searching for a stable place to live and it was just taking so long to find a stable place to live, so I was becoming anxious. A Yeah, I'm sorry. To hear that. B Thank you. Yes. A When was the last time you felt really happy? B Maybe in October, when my mother first came. She came to visit me in October, and when she first got here, we had a good time, first couple of days. So I was happy to see her. I hadn't seen her in over a year. I'm proud that I'm able to adjust to different situations. The older I've gotten, the more adaptive I am in different environments in different situations. And I've learned how to be more resourceful, so I'm proud of that. I'm sorry. My dad, my sister, she's positive because she's finished her master's degree. My mom, sometime my best friend, is very positive because she just started her new business two years ago and she's very enthusiastic about it. So that's an inspiration. A What are some things that make you really mad. B When someone lies consistently? I listen very, very well sometimes. I give good advice. I'm a good friend. I normally do the things that I say I'm going to do. So I'm dependable. I communicate well, and I enjoy people's company most of the time, especially if they're in good moods. A What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? B Being around positive people. Music puts me in a good mood. Comedy shows put me in a good mood. Good food puts me in a good mood. When I graduated from high school, it was a really. I will never forget it. It was a wonderful day. Very confident, accomplished, and I was extremely optimistic and hopeful for the future. A That's so good to hear. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing, sharing your thoughts with me. B You're welcome. A Goodbye. B Bye.

B To own my own non profit organization that provides services for women that are considered marginalized populations. A Okay. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B I like to travel, but no, I don't travel a lot. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Oh, the different cultures, the different architects, the knowledge that you acquire. Variety of foods. Okay. I can tell you that one of my favorite places is Sedona, Arizona, because it's so beautiful and it's so clean and open. A Nice. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Neither. I can be. I can be really shy, but I force myself to be more outgoing though. I think people perceive me as very outgoing. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I go on Facebook or I check my emails or I watch movies. A Temper. B Sometimes I'm really good for the most part. But there are times when I'm feeling very stressed and I have temper outburst, anger outbursts. I don't know, about maybe 30 days ago. And it was about my inadequate parenting skills. A That sounds really hard. B How did you feel in that moment? Ashamed. Angry. Confused. But I also felt like I needed to have my perspective understood. I have four kids, three boys and one girl. My oldest son is living in Mar Vista and he's doing some menial job. He's creative and artistic and has a really good heart. My third son, my second son, because he's my third child, lives in Alabama. He has a daughter and he also has a menial job, but he moved there to be with his daughter. He's not together with his daughter's mother. And he's funny and really smart and wickedly clever. And my third son, my youngest, living in Los Angeles, is living on his own, working at a menial job, is kind of finding himself. He's extremely kind and sensitive and caring and loving. But he tends to be pretty hard on himself and has a lot of opinions about a lot of things. A Do you find it easy to be a parent? B I love being a parent, but being a parent isn't easy. A What's the best thing about being a parent? B The unconditional love you feel for your children. A What's the hardest thing about a. B Tolerating their shortcomings and their suffering and feeling, like, regret for not having done a better job. A What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? B I think I tell my children that I love them and that I'm proud of them and that I have a much more open communication and I'm more accepting of the choices that they make, even though I might not agree with them. A How close are you to your family? B I'm close to my sisters. I'm pretty distant from my mother. I was close when I was younger to my father, but he passed away when I was 25. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B My college professors. A Can you tell me about that? B I think that they helped me perceive a different perspective on human beings. Made me more altruistic and more open and less judgmental. A What's something you feel guilty about? B Being poor and unsuccessful? A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would Handle differently. B I think I could have made better choices regarding the fathers of my children and or stepfathers maybe when I left my kids. A Can you tell me about that? B My first marriage, I was really immature and unknowledgeable and felt that I couldn't provide for my children. So I made a choice to leave them with her father for a period of time and that was a regret. And then When I was 36, I was diagnosed with cancer and I had to make the choice of again leaving my kids with their prospective fathers. And until I got better, I wasn't able to be a full time mother. A That sounds really hard. B Yeah, it was. Separation from my kids is really hard. Separation from my kids is really hard. I feel ashamed and guilt and remorse because had I had a more stable financial and emotional and psychological foundation, I might have had the ability to not have caused them some of the problems that they have today. A Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Sometimes good. I have to be really tired. Sometimes not so good. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B Ineffective. A How have you been feeling lately? B Ineffective. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior? B I think I'm making more of a conscientious effort to get organized and take some steps to physical health. Well, being, getting out more, forcing myself to participate in life more. No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yes. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B Originally? I think I was diagnosed in 1980, maybe before that, but it was never a formal diagnosis. I tried to commit suicide. A Do you still go to therapy now? B Yes. A Do you feel like they're presusable? B Sometimes. A What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going therapy? B I am no longer truly suicidal. A You felt really happy? B I don't know. 2006, 2007. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Went to the beach for a walk with my dog. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I have a great ability to empathize. I am open to learning. I crave learning. I'm socially empathetic. I love my children. I'm a good friend. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Well, my depression is one thing. I wish I was more intelligent. That school was easier for me. I wish I didn't have such low self esteem. I wish I could be more motivated in participating in areas that I'm interested in. Yeah. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Go to college. A What are you most proud of in. B Your life, my children. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Goodbye. B Goodbye.

"A All right. Okay. Now she's going to ask you some questions, and then when she's done, she'll say goodbye. After she she says goodbye, please press this button to let me know you guys are done. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing fine, thank you. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B Los Angeles. California. A Really? What are some things you would like about la? B The variety of people, the multicultural food and going to movies. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B Rude people. Scary people. It's violent. A I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B Yes. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Experiencing different things, seeing different cultures. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B Well, I was stationed in Germany for three years. It was a great experience. The food was great. The Bavarian Alps, the snow, the people. I loved it. A Nice. What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Having a baby. A Can you tell me about that? B Well, it was just the most memorable thing in my life. Something I'll never forget. A How did you feel in that moment? B Great. A Tell me about your kids. B One son. Grown, handsome, father of two. A Do you find it easy to be a parent? B No. It's actually very hard for me. A What's the hardest thing about being a parent? B Not becoming angry too quickly. A What's the best thing about being a parent? B Being able to cultivate a mind and love someone unconditionally. A What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? B Well, I went through a lot of trauma as a child. So as a parent, I was very afraid for my child to go through that same trauma. Tried to protect him from it. A How hard is that? B I think it's really hard because you never really know people and what they'll do. A Yeah. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Outgoing. A Why? B Because if I'm in a room with people, I'm usually the first one to start talking. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the Best I've got. What do you do to relax? B As a matter of fact, I have fish aquarium. That's what keeps me calm. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Not very good. A When was the last time you argued with someone? B Seems like every day I argue with somebody about something. But yesterday. A Can you tell me about that? B A lady tried to cut line in the grocery store and I politely told her I was in line and she didn't want to move. A Has that gotten you in trouble? B Yes, it has. Because sometimes if people don't want to move, then I feel it's my place to move them. A What's something you feel guilty about? B Hurting people physically. A Can you give me an example of that? B If I feel disrespected or somebody puts their hands on me, I can get very ugly. I don't like that about me. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B I was pulled over by the police and they had someone with my name and they were very rude to me. And I really wasn't happy with the way they treated me. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B How to stay calm when someone has crossed over into my boundary, my personal space. A Can you tell me about that? B I can't let people get too close to me. If they do, I lash out. I don't want anybody in my area of protection, I guess. A How do you cope with them? B Stay away from people. Stay away from them. It's hard. You can't live in this world without other people. Sometimes they just irritate the heck out of me. A Yeah. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from in the night. B Being assaulted in the military is something I wish I could forget. A Can you tell me about that? B Just that I felt helpless, alone, ashamed and angry. That's about all. I want to go into it. A Okay. How old were you when you joined the military? B 18. A You were very young, weren't you? B Yeah, very young. A Did you ever. B No. A How did serving in the military change you? B Because I was assaulted. And I have a fear of people in uniform, like policemen hurting me or other military veterans hurting me when they explode or go off or have issues of ptsd. A I see. When was the last time that happened? B I can't remember. A What did you do after the military? B I worked for the federal government. A How did you do decide to do that? B Well, it just seemed like a normal progression. Federal government gives you 10 points preference over other people for being in the military, so seemed like a natural choice. Organization that had A book of rules. And they followed them, the government. One government to another. A Are you happy you did that? B Yes. A How easy was that for you to go back to civilian life? B Well, it was hard in the sense that in the military, you're given. You're told to handle it, handle it. And in the civilian world, you have to go through so many hoops and different people to talk to to get something done. A Yeah. What did you study at school? B Administration of Justice. A Are you still working in that? B No, I don't work anymore. A Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Oh, yeah. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B Almost two years. A What got you to seek help? B The feeling that I was always gonna be hurt. That someone was out to get me. I had nightmares. Panic attacks, anxiety attacks. Outbursts of anger. I was always in emotional pain, and I always wanted to hit somebody. A Are they triggered by something? B Yes. Mostly disrespect. What I feel is disrespect. Or people getting too close to me. Or I feel in fear of them for some reason. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B I can't remember the last time I had a good night's sleep. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B What? A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B Irritable. Angry. Moody. Pissed off. Irrational. Tired. Sick of the world. Angry at the world. Wanting to be left alone. Sometimes I don't want to go on. A Do you still go to therapy now? B Yes. A Do you feel like therapy is useful? B Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. A What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? B Well, I can recognize a trigger now. When something is going to trigger me, I can at least. No. And act accordingly if I want to. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B When I saw my grandchildren, when they came to visit. A Can you tell me about that? B They're just so innocent and sweet and precious. It was just a joy to have them around. They make me forget about all the pain in life. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Planting seeds for some vegetables. Making a garden. A That's great. What made you decide to do that? B I read somewhere that it's calming and soothing to work with your hands in dirt. So I decided to find out. Plant something and watch it grow. A Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B Sitting on the beach. Look. Facing the water. Thinking. Talking to God. Wishing I was somewhere else. A Like what? B Like Hawaii. Penthouse over Maui. That I could trust people. That I wouldn't lash out. At them that I could sleep at night. A How would your best friend describe you? B Crazy. Hot headed. Emotional. A Mm. Is there anything you regret? B Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Don't trust anyone. Be careful. Be wary of people and what they want from you. A What are you most proud of in your life? B I said my grandchildren. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B I don't have a real family. I haven't seen my brothers in like 20, 30 years. I only have two brothers and I don't. I haven't seen them. My mother's family I haven't seen in years. My father's family I haven't seen in years. My parents are dead. My son lives in another state. Wow. Some of the older people that I give care to, sometimes I'm a caregiver. So sometimes the people that I work with, older and wiser. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm loyal, spiritual, supportive, kind, generous. A That's so good to hear. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to.

B No, not a lot. A Why? B Well, I can't afford to travel as much as I'd like to. A Okay. What'd you study at school? B I was an English major. A That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? B I just liked reading a lot at the time, so it sounded like the best thing. Well, the most fun thing to study. A Are you still doing that? B No, not anymore. A I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? B I guess my dream job would be to manage a soccer club. A How hard is that? B Oh, it'd be pretty much impossible for me. A Why? B I don't have any experience in that field. A I understand. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Very shy. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I play music. A What do you do when you're annoyed? B What do I do when I'm annoyed? I don't know. What do I do when I'm annoyed? I can't think of anything. I don't know. I don't think. Yeah, I don't do anything specifically. A How are you at confidence? Controlling your temper? B Pretty good. I would say very good. I don't lose my temper very often. A That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? B When was the last time I argued with someone? I can't remember. Yeah, I don't have a lot of conflicts with people. I can't remember the last time I argued with someone. A Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory? B Well, let's see. When I was a little kid, I was outside my grandparents restaurant and there was a robbery and I saw it. Well, I saw it when the robbers were leaving. Yeah. Maybe I would want to erase that from my memory if I could. A How did you feel in that moment? B Well, I didn't know what was happening in that moment. So I didn't feel so bad at the time, but I felt bad afterward because then, you know, my mother was upset by it. My mother was there and she had to call the police and it was. It was disturbing to see her, you know, really disturbed that way. But at the time that it actually happened, I wasn't really upset. It was more the aftermath of it. A Yeah, that sounds really hard. B What about a situation that you wish. A You had handled differently? B A situation that I don't know. Well, I can think of. There's probably a million situations that I would wish I would have handled differently. I can't think of one in particular. Maybe I think that when I was a kid I. Well, I think that when I was. Lets see. Oh, I have. Okay, I have a good one. I didn't marry the girl that I think that I should have married. So that's a big one for me. A Can you tell me about that? B Yeah. Well, we were together for about four years and I think I just took her for granted and I just didn't commit. And that was a long time ago. And now that it's been so many years, I realize. Well, I don't know if it's a realization, but I think now that yes, she should have been my wife, that we were meant for each other or made for each other. But because my selfishness and because I just had this fear of commitment at the time, I just felt like I didn't. I didn't do what I should have done, what the smart thing would have been. A What's something you feel guilty about? B Well, the last thing I can think of that I would say I feel guilty about was, you know, I feel a lot of guilt about my friendships. I don't feel like I'm as good of a friend as I could be. But then at the same time, I don't really know exactly how I could be a better friend. I just feel a little guilty that I'm not. I can't help people. Anyone who has a problem, I can't. I never feel like I can help anyone who I know who has a problem. A When was the last time that happened? B That happens every day. I Guess that happens with everyone who I know and everyone. All of my relatives and all of my friends. I don't feel like I can really give them anything or help them in their lives. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B Well, it's very distant. It's just. It's very cordial and it's very. I don't know what the word is. It's on the. It's kept at a very surface level, I don't think. I don't think that my family really knows me very well at all. And I don't know them very well either. Not in a true sense. So, yeah, I think a lot of families are that way. But it does bother me that mine is that way. A Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Oh, it's very easy. I sleep a lot and I. Yeah, I have no problem sleeping at all. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B No, not. Not really. I would say the way I am now, it's the way I think I've been my whole life. So even when I was a little kid, I slept a lot also. And, no, I don't think I've changed much. A How have you been feeling lately? B Pretty down. But like I said, in a way I could say, yeah, I'm feeling really down. But then again, I've always been this way, so it's hard to say that it's down when it's consistently that way. A Yeah. Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yes. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B Oh, a long time ago. I was about 10 years old or around there. A What got you to seek help? B I was just missing a lot of school. I didn't want to go to school. So eventually they sent me to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then. And then to a psychiatrist, and it went from there. A Do you still go to therapy now? B No, I haven't gone to therapy since I was a teenager. A Why did you stop? B Well, I didn't feel it was helping me at all. So one day I just decided I didn't want to go anymore. A How has seeing a therapist affected you? B Well, like I said, I didn't feel that it helped me. So I guess I don't know that it affected me much. A Do you have disturbing thoughts? B No, I wouldn't say disturbing, no. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Well, I feel pretty happy whenever I see my nephew and I have my best friend's children. I feel like they're my nephew and my niece and I'M pretty happy when I'm around them. A That's great. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B My ideal weekend would be. I would probably be traveling. I would really enjoy just getting out of the city every weekend. Going anywhere, really. Just anywhere out of the city. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Just seeing the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go. I really do think people are different when you go to different places and how they interact with you and how they see the world. Different food. And. I also like historical places. I'm into history and I. And I enjoy just visiting anywhere that has some sort of historical significance. A Awesome. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B I haven't taken a trip in a long time. The last trip I really took was I went to France a few years ago for a wedding, and I had a really good time there. I had always wanted. Wanted to go to Paris, and so I got to go to Paris, and then I went to a little town that's a few hours away from Paris where the actual wedding was. And, yeah, it was really fun. I think the church where the wedding was was like a thousand years old. A Wow. B Yeah, it was a really cool trip. A What's one of your most memorable experience? B I don't know. I don't. I don't know. What's. What would. Would be considered memorable? A Whatever comes to your mind. B A memorable experience. Probably the most memorable experience, I guess, would just be nothing in particular, but living with a girl who I told you earlier that I think now that we should have gotten married, that's something that stays in my memory. That's why I'm saying it's memorable, because it's still with me, and it's something that I don't think, you know. Well, I know I'll never forget, but it's not any particular day or any particular moment, you know? A Yeah. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Well, a lot. Wish I could be healthier, for one thing, more energetic and more friendly. Well, I think I am pretty friendly, but more outgoing, more social. Those two things. Mainly, I guess I would like to be more social, more enthusiastic and more. And healthier. A How would your best friend describe you? B That's a good question. My best friend. How would my best friend describe me? I think. I think he would say that I'm a very. Well, it sounds cheesy, but he would probably say that I'm a very spiritual person and that I'm very giving. I think I'm a lot more selfish than people think I am, but people think that I'm not selfish. And probably he would say that I'm creative also. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Well, my advice to myself. I don't understand the question. A Is there anything you regret? B Yeah, but we already talked about it, right? A What are you most proud of in your life? B No, I can't. Well, I don't think that I really believe in being proud or in pride. I don't think that accomplishments are really something to be proud of, but I can't really think of any accomplishment anyway. Even if I did have something to be proud of, though, I can't think of anything, any sort of accomplishment I've had. A Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Something I did recently that I really enjoyed? Well, I sang karaoke with a couple of friends of mine and I don't usually do that, but. Yeah, that was a lot of fun a few days ago. A Cool. Okay. I think I lost everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Thank you. A Goodbye. B It was more difficult than I thought it was going to be. She just kind of had me stumped a lot. A lot of the time. And I was. I think I got better after a little while. And I was. Yeah. At first I thought, oh, they're going to get mad because I'm not saying anything and I don't know how to answer. A We appreciate you coming in regardless.

"A Okay, that looks great. Okay, so again, when she's done, she'll say goodbye. Just press this button and I'll come back in. B Okay. A Thank you. Hi. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing well. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B I was born in Oakland. A Really? What are some things you really like about la? B All the different areas of the city, the different cultures that are here. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B The traffic, the lack of public transportation, and the superficiality. A I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. B Do you travel a lot? I don't. I would love to travel more. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Um, being able to experience a different way of living. Getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and getting a different perspective. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B In 2008, I studied abroad in Brazil, and that was about four months. And I was in Bahia, which is in the north, and the program consisted of learning the history, learning the language, and staying with a homestay family. A Nice. What made you decide to do that? B I've always wanted to travel, and I chose Brazil because they have an Afro Brazilian population or a large Afro Brazilian population, which I really wanted to learn more about. And I think the history and the culture is really interesting. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B I think taking a bus by myself to a remote beach and just navigating on my own and figuring out where to go. Yeah, that's great. A What'd you study at school? B Right now I'm getting my master's in social work. A What's your dream job? B Dream job? I think to consult about mental health and how to. How to intervene effectively with different cultures and doing research and consulting work and getting to travel, basically that those would be the main characteristics. A Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I think that's a false dichotomy, but I do consider myself shy, but at the same time outgoing in the sense that I push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone. And I'm determined to do what it takes to become successful. A That makes sense. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I listen to music and just lay on my bed and I guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things. Also breathing exercises, which I'm learning more about as well as exercise. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Pretty good. I don't get angry a lot, so as far as angry temperament, I'm pretty good at that. A That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Hmm, umm. What month is this? May, probably two months ago. And I argued via text message. So it's not really intense arguing, but I guess you'd call it arguing in a sense over whether or not I should be forgiven for something that I thought was minor. With a friend I've had for a few years, I felt anxious, sad, and angry. Yeah, those are the main emotions. A How do you know them? B I know them because I think I'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them. And then I'll notice the physical manifestations of emotions, like if my heart's racing or if I'm getting sweaty. If my breathing is more shallow, I'll know I'm anxious. I'll know something's bothering me. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Hmm, that I wish I had handled differently. I guess related to this argument. I went out one night and got a little too intoxicated and ended up calling a person for a ride home. But that really upset that person. And I know that it wasn't such a big deal, but I wish I hadn't have let myself get to that point. It impacted a relationship and I also felt really bad about what I did. A Okay, tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Hardest decision or, wow, probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into. I briefly went to law school and decided not to do that. So afterwards, after dropping out, I had to really rethink what it is that I wanted to do and what I wanted to dedicate my life to go into debt for spending a lot of energy on. A How did you decide to do that? B I think by recognizing what I don't want to do and doing a lot of research on program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program. A That makes sense. Tell me about an event or something that you, you wish you could erase from your memory. B I have to think revolving around the same person I spoke of earlier. It was a dating relationship. And a few years ago we had a falling out over his treatment of me and it involved another person. And I wish I could get that out of my mind. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. Um. B I have a pretty good relationship with my mom. She lives in the Bay Area. I didn't grow up with her, but I've gotten closer to her as an adult. We talk pretty regularly with my dad. I grew up with him mostly. He lives in Atlanta and we don't talk as much, but we are. We have a pretty decent relationship. It's not really that contentious or anything. And I'm an only child, so I don't have siblings, I don't have a large family. So in general, I'm not really that close to family. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B One person is my mentor who I met in 2004. 5 and she's a judge. And I met her when I was in community college. And she really opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that I would be able to achieve certain things. A That's great. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Pretty easy. Well, it's easy for me to sleep. What's not easy is getting up. A Why? B Because usually I do not look forward to what I have to do that day. And the thought of it is, you know, just makes me want to stay in bed. Also, I wake up pretty tired. Not really feeling refreshed. A I understand. B I think just self talk about how what I have to do isn't that bad or that the things that I'm doing now are going to end pretty soon. With the end of the school year, trying to think of things that I can look forward to in the week. Also listening to music and browsing the Internet kind of gets my mind going. A How have you been feeling lately? B Feeling wow. Feeling emotionally drained in some ways and at the same time feeling like I've accomplished a lot and that I've grown. A So. B So a mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of feeling accomplished and proud at the same time. A Uh huh. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No, I haven't. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yes. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B In 2006. A What got you to seek help? B The convergence of a lot of stressful factors. I was out of touch with my mom. I Started well, I transferred to a university that was pretty rigorous, and just all those changes going on really exacerbated things that were already there. Depressive tendencies that were already there. And it got to a point where I just felt really overwhelmed. A Yeah. Do you still go to therapy now? B Yes, I do. A Do you feel like therapy is useful? B Yes. A What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? B I notice I'm better able accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them. I'm able to think differently about things that happen, maybe look at things in a more positive light and also identify the areas I need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B This past weekend, I reconnected with some old friends, and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again. A Awesome. How would your best friend describe you? B People have different takes on me. I don't have one best friend, but I think people would describe me as very analytical, sensitive, intelligent, intellectual. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B I wish that I did not. Or wait. I wish I was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression, which I'm working on, and I wish that I had more energy. A Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Start going to therapy now. But yeah, I really would. And also to. What? How old am I? 28. 10 years ago? 18. Okay. So graduating from high school, I would tell myself to pick up some. Some more job skills so that I wouldn't have to struggle as much in the future and to seek out mentors to get a clearer idea of what I wanted to do as a career. A Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? B I think the fact that I'm in grad school and coming from the background that I. That I come from low socioeconomic status and just pushing through challenges to get here. A That's so good to hear. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to.

"R I will also do something that seems even funnier. All right. Okay, so now I'm going to start the virtual human and I will give you the doorbell when you're done. B ok? Hmm. Hi, I am Ali. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started and do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confident. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B I didn't sleep much last night and it's cold and I'm just going to spend the day. I did not shower in two days. I need to change my clothes and have my hair cut and get together. Be more awake. Eh. Who sucks. B Okay, I know. Where are you from? B New Jersey. A really? Why did you move to it? B It was 30 years ago. My cousin came out here and said I could also go. Nothing happens here in Jersey City. I'm going to go out. It was inside. Are you used to living in it? B Very easy, very easy. Just like, you know, you find your work from 9 to 5 to pay the rent and a lot to do here. What are the things you really like at? B probably the film industry and celebrities, glamor and excitement. Yeah, I integrate myself really well. What are the things you don't really like at it? B hmmm. Hmm. Wow. Oh, well, just like probably the problem of the homeless, but you have to see the abandoned and they eat out of the garbage and you know, we are the capital of the homeless of America and you have to see this everywhere. R I see what you mean. What have you studied at school? B I just finished my secondary studies, but I'm interested in writing, you know. What decided you to do this? B What made you decide? No, I'm interested in reading and words and creating stories and imagination. But I haven't written anything for a while. It's my drug. I do not drink, do not smoke or do these types of drugs, but writing has always been what made me high. A it's good. B Yeah, but I was not inspired. But I recently met a young girl who is a stand and her routine is so interesting. I could write a novel about his routine. Anyway, tell me about it. Oh, I don't know, actually Facebook. She told all these things about how she was friends with a homeless woman and a homelessness can inherit $ 4 million if she comes down from the street. And she has an autistic sister who is very Strange but is crazy about guys. And she is 20 years old and wants to be a comic strip. And she is really talented. I watched it, but she didn't respond. All right. Do you consider yourself an introvert? B probably. Yes. Yes. One why? B trying to think, what does introvert? Yeah, well, I keep. Do I keep everything in me? Probably, yes. And I always think, probably all the time thinking about my problems and too much analysis. Yeah. What are the things that make you really crazy? B probably passionate perforated, people are just living in government, will get their section A. They do not go out and do not work and manage for themselves and take care of themselves. Go crazy. Just people who are so lazy. And some who go, they walk, they are in traffic with their panels, give me money. Please help me. Please help me. Help. Help me, help me. This is what drives me crazy. I try to just face it and try simply because I don't like being bored or angry. I don't cursed much. I try to stay calm, intelligent. So I try to face it and delete it and work it. How are you going to control your temperament? B I'm fine, but lately, I have had explosions and I probably only regret it because of the lack of sleep or simply the tensions that are increasing and the problems in progress. But I try to stay calm. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B oh, oh, wow. I don't like to chat, but I was arguing with a girl who worked in a movie theater and she gave people with bad directions on which line will be held. And she provoked, like the hassles. And I said, you know, they have to stand here and not send them there. They will not enter into the screening of the film. And there were arguments in progress. And of course, I was on the right. She gave bad information. It was at the Chinese theater of Grauman. A good. How far are you from your family? B well, I have a twin brother with whom I live, but we do not hear ourselves. We are total opposites. I have a sister I have not seen or probably talked about for 18 years. I have a younger brother. Do not see him much. And what is sad, just have a mother who is still there. It is like 70, 75, probably in the past three years. Just no communication, no phone. Calls. No Facebook. Just separated. It is as if we are not interested. One why? B This is the way she is still. I don't know. Well, never had a father. The father left when I was 4 years old. And she is I have always been a housewife, always. She has always been on well-being and food at the dams. She never really worked. I just want her to do something more. She is fair, you know, I love her, but we no longer have a relationship. A yeah, I understand. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B who was a positive influence? Probably good writers. Probably some of my favorite authors who inspire me to write better. I like the writer, like William Goldman. He is a very good writer. And he wrote Marathon Man and he wrote about how to write scripts, and he wrote the Princess Bride. It was an inspiration. A beautiful. What do you think of today's children? B What was it? What do you think of today's children? B today's children? Oh, just. I can answer that with two, three words. Well, just two aspects. It's just too much. Too much video games, too much technology, too much skateboarding. Just. It was better in the 70s. When I grew up, we didn't have to do it. We were not locked in rooms where we sat in front of the screens for hours and hours and hours, therefore. And everyone. Yes, it's 2013. It's. Everyone just tries to do it, you know, life is difficult for everyone, and everyone is just trying to go through. It's hard. How would your best friend describe you? B generous and funny and fun with and just a guy all around. Have you ever served in the army? B no. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B yes. How long have you been diagnosed for? Six years ago. What made you ask for help? B I'm probably right. When I probably went. Probably. I went to a free clinic. Things were bad. I was probably interested in the drugs, then when they offered it to me, I decided not to face it. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't want to take medication or anything. I was taking Lipitor for a high cholesterol and I obtained too many side effects. Fatigue and insomnia and dizziness. I don't take medication. Did you think you had a problem before discovering it? B because I am a creative person and I just suffered from depression all my life. I have my ups and downs. Oh, guy. I just feel blah. Just walk and feel nothing. Do not feel well about anything or excited by anything. Just bored. So bored all the time. How have you been feeling lately? B recently, I probably never felt so bad in my whole life. The past few years have probably been really bad. I am in Surviva L mode L on this subject. It's pretty bad. R Have you noticed these latest changes in your behavior or your thoughts? B I became a boring person. I’m going to all these free events all the time trying to save money. I went out every night. I am rarely at home. All the time going to events, having a good time then. But it's like I was just trying to close my life. I live in cinemas, just trying to block everything. It's not good. Are you going to always in therapy now? B no no. Why did you stop? B was not really in therapy, but. But you know, once again, he was a Korean, I just said, yes. Your depression. You have suffered from depression. I may even be bipolar, but, you know, I will face it. A good. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B Well, believe it or not, if it's just dark and calm, I sleep pretty well. Eight to ten o'clock sometimes because I snore. Sometimes I am not allowed to sleep. Sometimes I am expelled from the apartment. It is a small apartment. And I know I slept on the alleys. I slept, you know, in the doors just to experience it. I am not safe because, you know, that's where I can't sleep. This is when I get two or three hours. So there is your answer. Inside, I can sleep well because I'm still tired. I am very tired. And I'm a heavy sorher. I snore like a chainsaw. So there you have it. How are you when you don't sleep? GOOD. B I'm fine. I mean, I'm just. People can say that I am just sleepy and probably irritable and I just want to let the darkness come and let me get at least 4, 5, 6, in a way a little sleep. Please. If I have, then I'm fine. A good. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? B ok. I would say that I had a game. I had an addiction to the game that spoiled all my life, you know? Almost lost. When will I go back the last time I was happy? I probably took $ 60 in a casino, I transformed it into $ 1,200. So the next one. Well, so I had $ 1,200 in my pocket. Well, it was exciting. But of course, the next few days that $ 1,200 have been liquidated. It went because I was stupid and I became greedy. But this is where I am the happiest. Probably go to a casino and win or even stay even and don't lose anything. This is where my adrenaline is. Did that cause you to trouble? B yes, he has. It did me. Put me where I am today. Too much blackjack. It's bad. But otherwise, in the past three years, I haven't had, you know. No, I don't do it. Not much. I don't play. The game is not worth it. In the end, Yo You lose everything. Yeah. A I am sorry. B yeah, the excuses accepted. A qualities. B I am generous. I am very, you know, I am a nice guy. I'm not going to hurt you. And I am very reliable all around. Good guy. I will help you. I will lend you a few dollars. I think I'm fine. No, nothing to. I just hope. I just hope, you know that there is a second chapter in my life at my age. We will see. Right now, I'm wading, killing time. Probably. Probably for four years now, just nothing. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B say this again. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Manage money better. I never think I would have six figures at the bank, but I did it. But a large part, she evaporated very slowly. So this advice is probably not. Don't play. Keep your money. Try to find other means of excitement. But for me, being at this blackjack table with big wages was my reality. This reality was better than being outside the casino. My reality was right there. Now, Texas Hold'em. I did it well. I haven't lost much. I am a very good player. Blackjack, it took everything. What are you most proud of in your life? B that I had these 12 years. I had a casting company for 12 years and I provided people for movies and television shows and a lot of audience work. So I made a lot of money for 12 years and I have traveled, I had time for my life. So, at least on my deathbed, I can say from 96 to 2008, I was 12 years old that I would never have thought of having ever had. Just money. The money I really enjoyed. My excitement goes. Enter a great first of a film with the Gromit. It's free, and you get popcorn and soda and you see the stars. It's about as exciting as it is going at the moment. A great. B ok. A good. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. B Very good. Take care of yourself.

"A And it's always female. It's funny. B She's gonna ask you a series of questions and then when she's done, she'll let you know and you'll press this button to let me know. A Okay. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Yes. B Okay. So how are you doing today? A I'm okay, thank you. I was born in East Los Angeles. And yes, the freedom to explore outdoors with different weather temp, you know, with weather, temperature and climates. To go skiing or to the beach, maybe in the same day. I like that. B What are some things you don't really like about la? A I think probably the overcrowding and the smog. B I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? A Not frequently, but I have. B What do you enjoy about traveling? A Meeting other people and learning about their environment and their culture? Sure. The last trip I've taken outside of here was to Italy and that was my second time being there. And I enjoyed it more this time because I knew what I wanted to see when I came back and. And I was better prepared for Italians and their culture. I felt I wasn't, as you know, I was just better prepared, I thought, for that trip. B What's one of your most memorable experiences? A That would be being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the midst of acres and acres and acres of grapes was just magnificent. B What did you study at school? A Human development. B How did you decide to do that? A I actually didn't decide at first to do that. I started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant. And I went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant. Through the process, I learned that I had to do a long internship without pay. And I had a family, so I had to make a career choice quickly. And so the college offered Human Development as a major. And I just went right in and used my units that I had already acquired towards that particular major. And I'm happy with it. Currently, no, I stay at home. I have a little one. He's not so little. I'm preparing to go back to work in the meantime, I design jewelry. B Tell me about your kids. A Well, I have three children. I have almost four year old and then I have two older children, 17 and 23. B Do you find it easy to be a parent? A No. B What's the best thing about being a parent? A That your children, the love from them and for them is unconditional. All the stages that they go through, there's stages all the time for every age. And everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages. B What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? A I think I'm probably more in tune with those different stages. That's why it makes me crazy. And I think that my parents, the time that my parents were parents, it was just kind of like, you know, is she fed, is she dressed? She has a house, I mean, a roof over her head. And we're doing great as parents and we love her. And so there wasn't too much I felt that parents thought about in terms of parenting in that way. Like today, you know, there's books for every age, every year, month, you know, and so I think it differs in that way tremendously. B How close are you to your family? A Very close. B Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A Outgoing, Why? I don't. I don't feel uninhibited. I feel, you know, confident to talk to people. I probably talk more than I need to. B Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? A I bead. I do. I design jewelry. That's what I do to relax. B That's great. How are you at controlling your temper? A I'm pretty good. I. Well, I think I try not to. Not to feel or let others know what my emotions are when I'm upset, which is not good because if I don't do anything with them, then I know that at some point it's going to come out. And, yeah, that's something they have to work on, like exercising or something. It was my husband and it was about. He asked me whether I thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him. Really tired of talking about that same topic. B Can you tell me about that? A Well, it came. It spawned from a client of my husband's who's a female, and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things. And. And so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if I ever thought about it and what made me think about cheating. And he knows that I've been resentful of him. And did that make me feel like, did that make me want to cheat or did I think about cheating? And we've had this conversation a lot of times. And I mean, not just that, but I don't know just about cheating in general. And so I just said what I normally. Normally say is that I haven't cheated and that I did think about that when we were first together, but it was just a mere thought. And. And then his response was, I know that if we cheated on each other, we would never tell one another. And that just kind of, I guess, irritated me. I was really bothered by that. And I just started thinking, you know, we're having this conversation yet again. And why are we having this conversation? Are you the one that's cheating? And so that's how that went into that argument. I mean, it was in a. Yelling. I mean, it was part conversation and part texting, not talking at all. B Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. A Pretty much any situation that involves my children. And if I've yelled, because I really don't like, if I came to the point where I've had. Where I've yelled, it bothers me because I was yelled at a lot, and I just feel bad about that. And I try really hard to not handle any kind of situation that involves my children, no matter how upset I might get and result in yelling. B Okay, tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. A That would probably be whether to keep a pregnancy or not. B Can you tell me about that? A Yeah, yeah, I. I was just talking about it yesterday, actually, and I was pregnant and I had wanted. I wasn't married yet, and I had wanted to be married, but I just didn't think that it was the right time for me. And I had pretty much made up my mind that I was not going to keep that pregnancy, But I made the decision by myself. And when my partner discovered that I was pregnant, he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me. And so that decision was quite hard because I felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not. And hopefully this is on correctly. Hang on, this earpiece is falling off. There we go. That was probably the hardest decision. Actually, you know what? No, I wouldn't say that's the hardest decision I ever had to make. I'm sorry. The hardest decision that I had to make in my life was whether or not the hospital should unplug the life life support machine for my father or not. That was the hardest decision. B What made you decide to do that? A Because I knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that. And to have been to resort to the situation that he was in, not capable of doing anything at all either. Speaking for himself was beyond who he was. And I just couldn't see him like that anymore. And he would be a vegetable, I was told. So I agreed to resort that not hardly ever. Too many things running out of my mind and pretty much mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends. Even though I know that they're going to come. I mean, I'm constantly worried about how they are when they come home. And so you really can't fall asleep on the weekends most time. But sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep. I'm just exhausted. I pass out. But it's hard, very stressed. B Can you tell me about that? A My son has been dealing with some legal issues and currently is incarcerated. And it's been really hard. B Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? A Yes. I've been probably very short, moody, irritable. B Are they triggered by something? A Well, I often think about a lot of things that aren't even happening. My mind just goes from 1 point A to point B and I don't even know how I got there. You know, it's interesting. Yeah. B Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? A No. B Have you been diagnosed with depression? A Yes. B How long ago were you diagnosed? A About three years ago. B What got you to seek help? A My OBG suggested I see a psychiatrist. B Do you still go to therapy now? A Yes. B What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going therapy? A Well, I've in the process of changing therapist. So it's been about. Because the program that I was in lost funding and I lost my therapist or the therapist that I was working with. And so it's been about two months, maybe three now. But I did notice when I was in therapy that it was just an intricate part of my life, my week to see my therapist. It really helped me cope. B That's good. That's good. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. A When I picked up my son from when he was released from jail or go get her. Probably, you know, she would use the term hustler, but meaning that I'll. I'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to do what I need to do to support my family. I mean, you know, legally, of course. Outgoing. Maybe sometimes a little too outgoing for her. And compassionate, sensitive, loyal. B What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? A All the things that remind me of my mother. B Like what? A Well, yelling. The yelling part was one. Just the little things that used to drive me so crazy. I can see myself doing them and it bothers me a lot. Regarding what? B Whatever comes to your mind. A Too much, really. I don't know. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A To go to college right after high school. Not wait. And that I didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy. Or that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy. That you can certainly be successful and not in a relationship and still be happy and live life. B Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. What did I do? A I visited my son yesterday. And that was really good. Yeah. B How did you feel in that moment? A I was happy that he was safe. B What are you most proud of in your life? A My children and my accomplishments in school and work. B That's great. Okay, I think I've asked every question. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. A Bye. Part way this tilted back.

"So now I'm going to put this bell here. B ok. Very good, great. Thank. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started and do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B Yes, that's good. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. How are you doing? A I am great, thank you. Where do you come from? B originally I am from San Francisco. A really? When did you move to the? B originally, I moved here, Gosh, 1995. Then I went to Chicago, then to San Francisco, then returned to Los Angeles probably about five years ago. Wow, a lot of move. How often do you go back to your hometown? B never. One why? B There is nothing left for me. R I understand. How does he compare himself to the? B Time is better in Los Angeles, but the inhabitants of San Francisco are more beautiful. Why did you move to the? B My ex -husband prefers it here. This is why we moved. A good. What do you study at school? B I have a first cycle diploma in psychology and after that, I went to the law faculty. Who seems interesting. How did you decided to do this? B When I was at university, I worked in a law firm and I decided that I really wanted to be a lawyer. It was really interesting. Do you still work in there? B No, now I'm a stay at home mom. A Tell Me on your children. Do you find it easy to be a parent? B No, I love it, but it's difficult. You have to manage a life to make sure they become a good and successful person. What is the most difficult thing to be a parent? B It is easy to do the academics and things like that, you know. I'm good at that. The most difficult thing, I think, is to guide them emotionally to help him cross things with which he has trouble. I feel like I don't have all the answers. One yeah. What is the best thing to be a parent? B see them just to grow and live new things and discover life in the world. It's fair. It's really, really cool. What are the ways that you are different as a parent than your parents? B completely different. Completely different. I mean, I'm not a perfect parent, but I like my son. I take care of him. It is the first priority of my life and they were not at all like that. A Tell Me on your relationship with your family. B Well, my parents died. I I did not speak to my father at all before his death. I have a sister and a brother who, in fact, I don't know where they are. I don't talk to them either. A good. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B probably more shy because I consider myself more reserved. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii. B This is the best I have. What are you doing to relax? B I like to listen to music. Like what I have. I listen to all kinds of music. But my favorite when I relax is the music of the 80s. Congratulations but true. How are you going to control your temperature? B It depends on who I am. If I am with my son, I can control my temperament. If I am with my ex -husband or other adults. Yeah, I don't do it. SO. So when will go back the last time you. An argument with someone and what was it? B yesterday. And it was my ex-husband dating from the woman he deceived when we got married. Can you tell me? B UM, I discovered that he was cheating on me and I expelled it. And he told me yesterday that he continued to go out with her. Who seems really difficult. B yeah. How did you feel at that time? B UM, really angry and really injured. One yeah. I'm sorry. Tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. Hobo. I would like to have spoken to my father before his death. I would like to have settled our differences before his death. To Tell Me on the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. B The most difficult decision I have ever taken was to end my wedding. What decided you to do this? B because he was wrong. To Tell Me on an event or something you want to be able to erase from your memory. B it should be. Well, I don't know. I mean, I do not know if I would like to erase anything from my memory because that makes me who I am today. So I can't really think about an event that I would like to erase. R I see what you mean. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B I don't have a good night's sleep. It is not easy. I wake up a lot in the night. One why? B I don't know. I would like to know. If I knew it, I could change it. I could try to do something, but I don't. I don't know. What do you mean when he sleeps? GOOD? B Grumpy, irritable. How have you been feeling lately? B Grumpy. Irritable. Down. Mixed with anger. Can you tell me? B is just because of everything I go through with my ex-husband soon. What? I just keep him inside e. I mean, there is nothing else to do except. I mean, that's what it is, so I have to face it. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B yes. How long have you been diagnosed? B ten years ago, after the birth of my son. What made you look for help nine years ago? I felt like I couldn't face life. I was so broken down. I couldn't. I felt like I couldn't do anything. Are they triggered by something? B no. Do you still go to therapy now? B I don't go to therapy. I go to medication management, but I'm not talking about therapy. A go to a therapist who helps you? B I went to the therapists and no, they don't help. Can you tell me? B well, some people sit down and do not look at you and say nothing. You know, if I wanted to talk to me, I would. Others give advice which, I think, is simply not good and not on the point. One yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B UM, it was probably this morning. I played with my son. How did you feel at that time? B just really happy. I did not think of any of the other bullshit in my life. I could just forget it. So I really felt, really happy. How would your best friend describe you? B I think they would describe me completely different in the way I describe myself. But I think they would describe me as really soft because they have really sweet, confident, outgoing. Because that's what I try to be for people. So I think that's how they would describe me. What are the things you want to change about you? B I want me to be sad. I would like to be more confident. Is there something you regret? B UM, yes, there are a lot of things, I think. What advice would you give you 10. B or 20 years, it would be not to do it. Do not give my life to a particular person, which I did with my husband. To tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B I think I would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like Palm Springs with my son. Hold in the pool, have fun, go out of dinner. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B one of my. Two of my friends. Two very good girlfriends, I think I have been really positive influences in my life. Can you tell me? B his life is worse than mine, but we can always compatirations together is really positive. I mean, she is always happy, always standing, always looking on the right side. So that helped me a lot. A it's so good to hear. What Are you the most proud of your life? B my son. To Tell Me on something you recently did that you really enjoyed. B I went to a friend and we had a cinema evening. We watched an adult film and dinner and wine and the boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games and it was just a relaxed and fun evening. R that looks like an excellent situation. Okay, I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. B of course. A farewell. B bye. All right.

"A Are there any parameters or any. I mean, should I just talk naturally or just however I'm comfortable? Whenever you're comfortable, I guess. I'm going to go ahead and just. B Fix this just so it's not. Sorry. Okay, great. Just one last thing and then I'll. Perfect. Okay, so again, she'll let you know when she's done. I'm gonna hand you the doorbell, but I'll try to keep an eye on the time as well. A Okay, thank you. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming. Coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Yes. B So how are you doing today? A I'm okay. I'm a little pensive, I guess, A little down, but more or less okay. B I'm sorry to hear that. Where are you from originally? A I was born in Annapolis, Maryland, on the East Coast. Why did you move to LA originally? I moved because I went to film school. But then I decided to come. I moved back to Washington D.C. to do some work and now I'm back here again. B How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? A It's very different being from the East Coast. It just has a different feel to it. But living LA is very. Has a very different kind of attitude, I guess. And so it's a little difficult, but I. But I've gotten more used to it since I've been here. B How often do you go back to your hometown? A Not at all. When I left, things got. Things were sort of. I. I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to. To be with some people who were going to help me out. And I'm just sort of. I don't know if estranged is the right word, but I'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often. B How hard is that? A It's not easy. It's kind of. I miss a lot of people. I miss my old life before I lost my job. I miss some friends. I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there. So it's difficult. I mean, it weighs on my mind a lot. I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet. So it's hard. B Yeah. Do you consider Yourself more shy or outgoing? A Depends on the situation. I think I'm outgoing when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing. But when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with, I tend to be a lot more shy. So it doesn't really answer your question, but. B Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? A I have certain. I do a lot of writing. I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world, the music and the thoughts just kind of happening, really, it soothes me. It's like it's when I feel most relaxed, I guess. B When was the last time that happened? A A few weeks ago, I guess. I'd been working on a book on a novel. And when I was really. When I was really getting into writing it and it was really working for me, that was good. That was really good. I felt like I was accomplishing something and I felt really relaxed. B What was it about? A It was about a guy who was searching for something. It's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on earth with her just because sort of a. It's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing. B What made you decide to do that? A Well, I've always. I've always been a writer. Part of the reason I came to LA was because of screenwriting. So I wrote some screenplays and, you know, had a little bit of success with that out here and. But since then I've kind of gotten. Gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and have started to write more short stories and longer just creative writing. So I've been meaning to write a novel, but I was just waiting for the idea to really hit me. B How hard is that? A It's not easy. The parts when it's good, it's really good. But getting there is sometimes a real struggle. I find it difficult. I have a real love hate relationship with writing. When I love it, I just absolutely love it. But sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult. But it's worth it for the times when it's good. B I see what you mean. How are you at controlling your temper? A Good. I don't really have a temper. It's not. I mean, most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. If something is really, really stressful or if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation, I can lose it. But that's probably only happened to me three, four times in my whole life. I mean, generally I pretty much try to. When I'm upset, I get upset with myself, not with other people. B When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? A Last night? I guess I got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of. I forget. Well, no, it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I had already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay. So it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I ended up being wrong on that one. But it is. Yeah, that was. It wasn't a blow up argument, but it was a definite argument. B Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? A A lot? So much. I was in a relationship that I really, really. That I really wanted to work and I ended up. And it was partly due to. I hadn't. I wasn't on the right medication. And so I was going like everything that sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended. I mean, I wasn't. I wasn't mean, but I was. But I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it. And so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. So that was pretty tough. B Could you have done anything to avoid it? A Well, some of it was that I wasn't medicated properly. I mean, now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's completely kind of. I mean, I still get upset and I still get depressed, but it's not like it was. I don't completely lose it for days at a time. So I mean, I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had, if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain, then I would have. Then it would have probably been different. If I was who I am now, then I would have. I would, I would be. I would be. It probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have, but I mean, I could have. I don't know. I don't know if I could have done anything different, things being how they were. B Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? A I mean, it's possible. I mean, obviously, yeah. Because, I mean, that's what I do. I. I take little. I mean, I take little things, and I just think about them all the time in my head until it drives me crazy. I dwell on stuff, and it's like any little detail that comes up, I suddenly remember, and it can just throw me off for a whole day. I mean, I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed, and I feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school, which was years and years ago, which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore because it's so in the past. But I still get that feeling like I'm right back there. B Yeah, that sounds really hard. A Well, it's not easy. I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it. I mean, I dealt with it for a long time by drinking and, you know, just trying to, like, slow my mind down that way. But, you know, since the medication, it's been better. It hasn't been impossible to deal with. It hasn't been easy, but it's. But it's been better. B That's good. How do you cope with them? A Well, like I said, I do a lot of. You know, if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything, like, I kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. If I'm watching tv, I have to be playing a game on my phone. If I'm using the computer, I have to be watching a TV show or a movie in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that. I just need. I mean, I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them, but I just. I can't yet. B Are they triggered by something? A They're triggered by everything. Pretty much anything that I see. If I hear somebody with a Dutch last name, if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin, if I hear, you know, people talk about just anything, you know, I can reach back and connect to this. It's really. It's really. I don't know. That's the thing. I mean, I don't ever get a break from it. B That sucks. A Yeah. B How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? A I'm a very light sleeper, so I'm awake and asleep and awake, and I have no problem going back to sleep. But I generally, you know, don't. I don't know. I never really needed much sleep, so it's just only recently that I've really started to feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. I would usually stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine, go to work. But now it's like if I do that, I still don't get enough sleep. I don't conk out. I still just sleep very lightly. I get up, I toss and turn all night, you know. And now it's just, it's. Yeah, I don't sleep too great right now. B What are you like when you don't sleep? Well. A Pretty. I mean, I don't know, it's hard to. It's hard to know. I. I usually just kind of power through it and just. I'm like how I am now. I just, I just feel bad. B Okay. How long ago were you diagnosed? A Um, I think three, four years ago. It was when I had been taking stuff for anxiety for years before that. But then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said, you've actually got this situation. We need to get you on. The medication that you're on is not working. You need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this. So, yeah, that was kind of a turning point, but unfortunately it happened after everything went bad. So. B I don't know. How did you feel in that moment? A In the moment? I don't know. I don't really think I thought about it too much then. But looking back on it, I feel it really makes me angry. It really makes me, you know, given where I am right now, it makes me really angry that I'm. That I had. That I lost everything because of chemicals in my brain, because of things that I couldn't control and that, you know, the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me. I mean, I was paying, I was paying a lot of money to, to go see doctors and they were doing, they, you know, it wasn't, it was, it didn't help. It didn't work until, until, you know, I managed to find somebody who did work and I just. Yeah. So I'm. I'm like, thanks guys for helping. But it was a little, it's a little late now. B What got you to seek help? A There really wasn't any choice. I had to. I was a mess. It was either I was self medicating it was affecting my work. I mean, it was. Everything was just. There was a point where I really realized that, I mean, I just had to like make this different. But again, it was too late because, you know, then my review came up a few months later and you know, after, after everything, after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff, you know, they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around. So they laid me off. But it was at least that and not firing me, but yeah. So I got help, but it wasn't soon enough. B Okay. Do you still go to therapy now? A Not as much as I should. I go to a couple of meetings. I go to AA so that I can keep control of that aspect to it. And there's a therapy aspect to that. Unfortunately, being unemployed, my unemployment ran out. I'm getting my medication from the city of la. So you know, I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody. So I have a psychiatrist that I go see, but it's really very. I've only seen her three times in the past year. So it's basically to keep my medication coming. B Okay. A And then there's you. Yeah, right. B What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? A Well, like I said, I mean, just the talk. I mean, let's just take the AA for example, because that's probably the closest that I'm seeing with therapy right now. Just saying stuff out loud is just like getting this stuff out. Trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense that you can actually deal with is a big step regardless of who you're saying it to, whether it's a therapist or just a room full of, of drunks. You know, I mean, you're taking all that stuff that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can deal with, something that you can write down, something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. Right, yeah. B How have you been feeling lately? A You know, better than I, that I have been. I mean, it's sort of, it has its ups and downs. You know, I'm applying for jobs, five, six jobs or more a day, you know, and never getting a response, never getting an interview, never even getting close to being self sufficient again. It's hard. But that's like real world problems. I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control, like the depression is getting under control. So now it's just. I have to deal with real life, which is its own challenge. B Yeah, it can be tough to find a good job these days. A Yeah. B Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. A It was probably, you know, a couple of years ago. I was. I mean, the thing that immediately comes to mind is everything was going well at my job. I was making these great videos with this person that I. That I was having a relationship with. And we were really close. We were having fun together. And we went out and got a Christmas tree, and we spent all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree. And it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger. The bigger life that's out there. You know, like what normal people feel. You know, for that instant, I felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really, really liked a lot. And, you know, everything was going really well. And I mean, it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up. But for that instant, I felt like a normal person, a normal happy person. And part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that I don't know if I'll ever feel that again. So. B What are you most proud of in your life? A Probably the. Probably this educational series I did an educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation. It was really hard, but in the end it turned out really good. And I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about. And about the world around him. So I feel like that was a real contribution that I made to the world. B That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? A It was part of, you know, it was part of my job. It was a. We were trying to come up with. With new ideas for. Because we would put together videos and stuff to give, you know, to schools and everything. And they had done those before, but we decided to do something really big, you know, and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of. And there was a lot to it. And so it was probably the biggest project that the NSF had decided to do. And so we just kind. Kind of produced it. That doesn't really. Yeah. B Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. A I guess. I don't know. I don't know. It's been a while since I've. Since I've really thought about that. I don't know. Would I go somewhere? Would I. I don't know. B Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. A Thank you.

"A How long you guys gonna do this? B The study? Yeah, till I think next week, and then we're gonna launch another one in a couple of weeks. A Oh, really? So I should be looking out? B Well, actually, if you've participated in this one, you can't participate in the next one. Really? Similar. A So, any repeats? B But there's other studies going on around. C Here Sometimes if you check Craigslist. A Okay, got it. Thank you. C Perfect. Let me start this camera up as well. B Okay, so now I'm going to start with the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. She'll let you know when you guys are done and then I will give you the doorbell and you can let me know. A Okay? C Okay. A Thank you. C Thank you. A So I just hit the doorbell when I'm finished? B Yeah, she'll say goodbye and then you hit the doorbell. A Okay, got it. Thank you. C Hi. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Sure. C Okay. So how are you doing today? A I'm doing fine, just a little tired. California. C Really? A Yes. The weather? Not last week, but yeah, the weather. C What are some things you don't really like about la? A Fear of earthquakes. C I see what you mean. What'd you study at school? A Psychology. C Are you still working in that? A I am. I go to Harbor College. C Are you happy you did that? A I am. I wish I would have went sooner, but Better late than never. C Yeah. What's your dream job? A Probably. I'm not sure. I never really thought about it. I want to work in the field of psychology, but I'm not sure if I want to work with children or adults. So I haven't really decided. C Okay. Do you travel a lot? A No. C Why? A I don't know, I just don't. Maybe once a year. June, actually. I went to Orlando, Florida. C Awesome. Do you consider yourself an introvert? A Sometimes, yeah. But not as. I'm sorry. Watch tv, read a book, talk on the phone, mad my mom gets in my business. Other than that, I guess just frustrations with my son. C Do you find it easy to be a parent? A No. The hardest thing is raising a child with a disability, not knowing how you can help him. C That sounds really hard. A It is. It's very hard. I don't sugarcoat it at all. C What's the best thing about being a parent? A Just having my children. They're a blessing. I love them. With all the good and the bad. It's a part of me. And I just love the fact that I'm helping mold them into good human beings. C How close are you to your family? A We're really close. I mean, my family's small. We live within blocks of each other, but, yeah, we're close. C Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? A Good or bad? Most memorable? Just giving birth for the first time. It was just amazing. My son is 9 now, so I still remember it like it was yesterday. How did you feel in that moment? Like I was being born again myself. I don't know how to explain it. It's just very emotional. C Okay. Is there anything you're. A I don't know. I guess I have a lot of regrets, but none that I really want to mention. I guess. Stay in school. Don't get emotionally involved and let people deter you from your goals. C Could you have done anything to avoid it? A Oh, yeah, definitely. Did you want me to? I'm okay. I mean, I'm pretty easy going for the most part. I don't really have a temper, per se. Things frustrate me more than they anger me. Oh, that's easy. With my mother, she's like, I guess the argument stemmed from me wanting to socialize. She feels that I'm married with children, so I should stay at home, like, 99% of the time. And I wanted to go out and socialize with some ex coworkers, and she basically kind of put me down for it, as if I don't spend enough time with my children. It does. And I love my mom. I hate even having the thoughts of being frustrated with her because I always think, gosh, I don't want to get mad at her, and then something happens to her the next day. But she gets kind of intrusive. I don't know. C When was the last time you felt really happy? A Oh, I know. After the semester ended when I noted that, you know, I did well in school because I had been. It had been a long time since I went to school. So when I received my grades, you know, A and a B, I was like, wow, okay, I can do this. And it made me happy. And that was about a few weeks ago, I guess. Thank you. My mom. I know it's good and bad. I mean, for the most part, my mom's been a positive influence. You know, just sometimes, you know, she gets a little, like she wants to re Raise me or something like. She doesn't understand that I'm an adult. I'm going to make my own decisions now and pretty much have to let me do what I need to do. C How do you cope with them? A A lot of heavy breathing. I mean, I walk sometimes when I get a little frustrated. Whatever, I'll just go take a walk, you know, or just try not to think about it. C That's good. A Thank you. C Have you ever served in the military? A Yes, yes, the Navy. I was 19. Yeah. I didn't have any other options. I am. I probably should have stayed in a little longer. I was only in for four years, but, you know, I wanted to experience life outside the military. So I did my enlistment and then I got out. C How did serving in the military change you? A It made me a little bit more responsible than some of my friends that, you know, did not join the military. I could notice a big difference as far as, you know, how I live my life and how they live theirs. Just made me a little bit more responsible. Thank you. I worked in the medical field for about five years and. Oh, thank you. But it wasn't for me. I wanted to do something a little bit different. I didn't want to do patient care. I wanted to work with people, but not necessarily as a patient care provider. So I started going to school, and then I met my husband. I stopped going to school, got married, and I started working in a telecommunications field. And then we, you know, conceived our child. And after that, you know, that's it. I think I'm caring. Well, I know I am. I'm very caring. You know, I'm very honest to a fault sometimes. You know, I try to be as honest as possible with people. Sometimes it could hurt their feelings. But, you know, you gotta be honest. You can't let people think that, you know, you're not trusting. And if. Yeah, probably. I never really thought about it. I don't know, maybe I don't really think about it. I just try to be the best person that I can be, you know, so that's all I can do. I can't live for what other people think. I can only do what I need to do. C What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? A Um. I don't know. I never really thought about it. I guess it's just, you know, being around my kids, you know, I just love being around my children. That always puts me in a good mood. Thank you. Okay. Like I said, a little tired, you know, but, you know, for the most part. Okay. You know, I'm dealing with situations different. Well, I go to bed really early. So as long as I go to bed early, I get a good night's sleep. But I wake up early as well. So it's kind of like get in bed a little bit. I go to bed like 8, 8:30, and then I wake up at like 1 1:30. So very moody, very irritable, short. Short tempered, I guess. C Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? A If anything, I think I'm thinking more positively. You know, like I said, especially with my son having a disability, you know, I look at it as if, you know, it's not all bad. I mean, he has challenges, but I'm dealing with them a lot better. You know, as opposed to feeling sorry for him or feeling sorry for myself. You know, I'm just finding more avenues to work with him. You know, different resources to help him, as opposed to just feeling guilty or sad and depressed about it. Thank you. C Have you been diagnosed with depression? A No. Occasionally. Who does it? C Proud of in your life? A I don't know. Can we skip that question? Green seems to be the word. Kind of like. Yeah, probably green. Like naive a little. But at the same time smart. I think she'll describe me as smart. C That's great. A Thank you. C I think I've asked everything I need to. A Okay. C Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. A No problem. C Goodbye. A Bye. Oh, that's right. I gotta push the button. It was fine. I kind of skipped one question, though. B All right.

"A Now I'm going to pull her up and if you let me know if you can see her just fine without your glasses, then we recommend you take them off. But if you need them to see. B Her, you keep them on. A But you, we want you to see your face and everything. B So if it's more, you know, I better, I think from this distance, I think I better. C Of course. Okay, great. So here is the doorbell. B Okay, thank you. C Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. C Okay. So how are you doing today? B Okay. C That's good. Where are you from originally? B From here. From. From Alhambra. C Really? What are some things you really like about la? B The weather is really nice and everything's fair. Familiar. C What are some things you don't really like about la? B Sometimes there's too much congestion on the roads, too much traffic. C Yeah, I see what you mean. What'd you study at school? B I studied art and photography. C How did you decide to do that? B It was much a decision. I just kept noticing that I was very interested in it. C Are you still working in that? B Yes. C What do you do now? B I'm a photographer. C Nice. What's your dream job? B Oh, I suppose running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business. C Okay. Do you travel a lot? B No, not. No. I'm also an apartment manager. It keeps me tied down. C I see. How do you like your living situation? B It's fair. It's not the greatest. Because of being an apartment manager, I do have free rent, but. But I have to stay there a lot, so that sucks. That part does. The free rent part is very good. C What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Oh, gosh, my most memorable experience. It's hard to say. Well, I mean, there's good and bad memorable experiences. C Whatever comes to your mind. B Oh, well, I guess some. Like sports, success. When I was in high school, there was a few things that I was happy about and some art pieces I've made were memorable. And some bad things would be my father's death, you know. But those are very memorable. Not good, though. C Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Well, my parents and I have a lot of brothers and sisters, so my family. C How close are you to your family? B Fairly close. Most of them live around la. There's a few that are from distant. My brother lives in New York and my other brother lives in Maui. C What do you think of today's kids? B Mostly very talented, just more involved in technology than maybe I was or am. And they are. I think they're more of a hive mind than when I grew up. Seems like they were all hooked into social media. C What do you do to relax? B Go on a walk or watch television or play with my computer. Well, there's some. There's some kind of injustices that happen in not. Not big deals, but. For example, our parking situation got worse with some new district parking. That's kind of upsetting. And the city doesn't seem to want to make any exceptions or change some rules. And also some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting. C Can you give me an example of that? B Yeah. I worked at a high school dance this last weekend. And when we arrived at the site, the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it. That we had to go outside and then to get an okay to go inside. Because being outside, we weren't prepared for nor told in advance that we were to be outside. It delayed our setup time. And that wouldn't have bothered me except that on Monday morning the school called our boss and complained that we were late setting up when they told us to wait for them. And we told them we would be delayed if we wait until we still get a complaint. So that part is upsetting. And our work doesn't back us up at the office. They just need to please the school to maintain the account. So often when something like that happens, it means they will not send you out to work at that school. School again. Which would translate into less payroll hours for the photographers that were on that job. Yeah, that's how they do things. So that is upsetting. C How do you cope with them? B Most of the time I dust off my resume and start looking for other situations that are. That might be better. C That's good. B Yeah. C How are you at controlling your temper? B Pretty good. I usually might in the moment, I don't really lose it. But later I might vent or something like that. But on the location, I wouldn't do that. C When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Well, just today. We have a tight schedule today. And I have a friend that I'm sharing a car with today. And we. We Were arguing where to go first. And so we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things. And then after this was one of the things is over, then we're gonna do some more of her things. So. But it. C That's good. B Yeah. C Have you ever served in the military? B No. C Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Post traumatic stress syndrome? Is that what that is? No, I have not. C Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yes. C How long ago were you diagnosed? B Oh, I'd say 1980. Yeah, I think believe it was 1980. Yeah. My father noticed some symptoms. My father is just. Well, he passed away. But he was a psychiatrist. Well, I wasn't sleeping. I was laying around the house. I was waking up at noon, something like that. And I didn't have a focus like for getting a job. It wasn't clear enough. I remember some job interviews that I'd go to their front door and then I wouldn't go in. And I think that was all. All part of depression. C Did you think you had a problem before you found out? B Yeah, I thought I had a problem, but I didn't know what it was. C Do you still go to therapy now? B No. C Why did you stop? B Well, I went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that he thought that I was done, but. And I did get to a much better place. I have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression. So I think I'll have good days and bad days. C What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? B I think therapy makes you see what the. Like I thought of it as a filter or wearing a. As if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses. You don't really. You see everything through that. So you have to. I have to sort of try to take those glasses off for a little bit and double check. Am I really perceiving these things accurately or am I seeing it through a depressed viewpoint? And I try to look for clues about that. C How have you been feeling lately? B I think I'm slipping back a little bit. I don't do well during unemployed periods. I've noticed in my past, and right now we have it work slowed down, so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule's too wide open. For me, personally, as a depressed person, I think that structure is really important. It gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere on time and deal interact with people as those are all beneficial things. For someone who tends to be depressed. C Have you noticed any changes in your behavior? B Well, I don't know if it changes a little bit. I tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that uplifting, let's say, but it's more negative. Like I have been sort of thinking about how soldiers in the past, I don't know why but like the, during the Roman era or the ancient Greeks, how it would have been like to be in the, in a frontline battle with you know, just kind of in my opinion, crude weapons and no medical help. And I don't know, I said my mind seems to go there a lot where I'm just thinking about that and I've been look, looking at and reading books about that or video clips on YouTube and things like that or some other, other kind of like terrible doom type themes like I was watching on the animal show, like crocodile attacks and things like that where probably shouldn't dwell so much on that. C Is there anything you regret? B Oh, you mean life in general? Yeah. Well, I think I regret not finishing college. I think I had a. I think I was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well and didn't really. I didn't get out of college with a degree, although I was there seven years. But. So that's a big regret that I have. C What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B I think it would have been to. At certain points I probably should have sought therapy and also probably some outside help just with getting through finals. Just the logistics. I was an art major and I had no car. So a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and also to meet at away locations. I think it probably would have been worth it to do whatever it took to get a car at that time. C What would you, you say are some of your best qualities? B Well, I've been told I'm very patient and also I have some original, original artistic ideas. So those are, those are good qualities. I'm very loyal and also, you know, I support my friends. Fairly generous with them. So yeah. C Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoy. B Let's see, let's see. I really enjoyed was. I had a, I had a nice experience just photographing a soccer game recently. I really enjoyed that. C So I love listening to people talk. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. B Okay. C Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B It's my pleasure. Thank you. Goodbye. Oh, I did, yeah, that was very interesting. C So I'm going to go ahead and. B Stop the recording, and then if you.

B A friend of mine was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved, so I went with her and it went from there. So I don't know. I made the decision that way. A Are you happy you did that? B I am. I am happy I did that. It's something I'll never forget. A That's so good to hear. What did you study at school? B I studied English and education so that I could teach high school students? Not currently, no. Well, right now I tutor privately for a private tutoring company and looking to get back into the classroom working as a teacher. A What's your dream job? B Well, anything that combines teaching, traveling and writing would be a dream job for me. So, yeah, anything that combines those three items. So teaching has the closest I've come to that. A Do you consider yourself an introvert? B Occasionally, yes. I don't know. I guess in comparison to others that are considered outgoing and a lot of people have said I seem reserved or kind of introverted. I don't know. A Okay. What do you do to relax? B Well, I don't know. I read. I just started meditation. Try to breathe and calm down. A Yeah. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? B Some things that make me really mad. Mistreatment of children, abuse of children. A I see what you mean. What do you do when you're annoyed? B Try to figure out what's annoying me usually, and then go from there. If I can control not being annoyed, ultimately I control that, whether or not I'm annoyed. So try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not be annoyed if I can help it at all. No, I'm fine at controlling my temper, I think. So I don't have. Yeah. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B The last time I argued with someone was, I don't know, maybe a couple of days ago. And. And it was about a smell they had on their clothes that I thought smelled like perfume, and they said it did not. A That sucks. B This is cool. A How close are you to your family? B I think I'm very close to my family. We're a pretty close knit family. Talk every day, see each other most every day. A That's great. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B There have been a lot of positive influences in my life. I would say my aunt and definitely my mother have all been positive influences. A Tell me more about that. B Well, I look, I. I look up to my aunt. I think she's positive. I look up to her because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds, came from very similar neighborhoods and areas, and she's very successful despite the types of things that we've gone through as children. And she doesn't let her past define her future. My mom's overcome so many obstacles as well. She has some challenges with her health, but she's still tries to be optimistic and she still tries to, you know, overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have. So I look up to people who are able to, you know, not allow their current situation to dictate their future, because anything is possible. A Yeah. That's great. Have you ever served in the military? B No, I have not. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B I have. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B Well, I was diagnosed within the last year and then again most recently within the last three months. A What got you to seek help? B Well, fear and Just not knowing what to do with some of the things I was feeling and not knowing, you know, why I couldn't stop feeling the way I was feeling. There were a lot of symptoms. You know, mostly I gained a lot of weight. I couldn't sleep a lot. And then sometimes I could sleep too much. Felt sad sometimes, like I wanted to cry a lot. A How have you been feeling lately? B I've been feeling okay. There are days you have? I don't know. Every day is different, so. I mean, today I feel fine, but like I said, everything's differently. And lately I've been feeling more like I can be involved in my own life and like I want to get out and do more things. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts? B No. No, no. No, I haven't. Not any different from before, what I was experiencing before. A Do you still go to therapy now? B No. A Why did you stop? B Well, I was receiving, I guess, psychotherapy and. I don't know, a lot of things happened. I moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother, and I just kind of got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while. Sometimes. A Do you feel like therapy is useful? B I do. Yes, it is. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B It's kind of difficult. I either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep. I'm sure it is. I just don't know what it is as of yet because I. You know, usually it's thoughts, continual thoughts running through my mind that either keep me up or make it hard for me to go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep. A How do you cope with them? B Journal, sometimes that might help. If I can write some things down and get it out, that helps. Other than that, I don't, you know, haven't found any really great ways of coping. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B Tired. Yeah, mostly tired. Kind of confused. A Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? B I don't know. For the most part, I feel happy. It's just last time I felt really happy was, I guess, over the holidays. A I'd love to hear all about it. B I don't know. I guess just being around family and friends, just the holiday season, I guess in general, that was just a happy time for me. And seeing people I haven't seen in a while, that's about it. A Okay. How do your best friend describe you? B How would my best friend describe me? Probably as quiet, sometimes cautious, talkative. Sometimes Tenacious. I don't know. A lot of my friends say that they look up to me for some of my accomplishments. And they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because I'm caring and compassionate or easy to talk to, that I remind them of, feel like a sister to them. A That's great. Is there anything you regret? B Everyone has regrets, I'm sure. Yeah, I guess so. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. B To just relax and be yourself and just go ahead and. It sounds cliche and I don't mean to sound that way, but it's true. It's just you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you to not compare yourself to other people. Because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time. It doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it. It just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their. Their time and their progression to how they get to things. So I would tell me 10 years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that I want for my life and don't be. Yeah, that makes sense. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B I really enjoyed working with. Well, okay. A science project with my younger relatives, my cousins. We did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made. A Awesome. What are you most proud of in your life? B Being the first to attend college in my family and then going to college and coming back to the community where I went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping youth or children that come from the same background that I came from. So I'm most proud of being able to have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and help someone else improve and better themselves as well. A That sounds like a great situation. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. B Goodbye. I guess I'll press this. Hi.

"A good. Okay, it seems good to me. So if you want to wave your hands a little, make sure that the connection will pick up your body. B there we go there. A good. It looks good. Oh, in fact before that, something that I almost forgot. I have to do something that flows our equipment. We go there. B Very good. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to start and do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. A it's good. Where do you come from? B los Angeles, California. A really? B yep. What are the things you really like at? B Lights, the big city, it's always something going on.

And I guess people think you are more stupid than you are. Try to move away from everything. Go very well in my own space. I am perfect for controlling my temperament. Probably like two days ago and it was probably a little more sports. It was not a real argument. Not much, but I travel enough. What do you like in travel? B just be able to change rhythm. See someone new, see new faces, a new environment. Let me see. The last trip I had was Vegas. You know how VEGAS is. It was quite fun. It was a lot. Lots of alcohol consumption and a lot of celebration in progress. Quite open -minded. I'm nice to almost everyone. I am a guy who is still killed. Everything is fine. It could be better. Do you have roommates? B no. It's good. Have you ever served in the army? B no, madam. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. How easy is it for you to have a good night's sleep? B recently it was quite difficult, I suppose that beak Aye I was standing so late. But this is my fault. I don't know. I guess I am a night bird. All of a sudden, I turn into an owl. A good. How are you when you don't sleep well? B slow and tired all day. If I don't sleep well all day, I'm just lying down. R Have you noticed these latest changes in your behavior or your thoughts? B No, not too much. A good. Is there anything you regret? B no. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Stay concentrated and listen to adults. R could you have done something to avoid it? B Yeah, tell me more about it. I mean self -explanation. I could have listened to parents or other adults who try to direct you in the right way. And you know, you are a stubborn child at these ages. So it's like, what? What are you talking about? It's my life. I can do what I want. I don't have to listen to you. But now I see that what they said was correct. How would your best friend describe you? B hilarious. Ok, how close to your family are you? B fairly close. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B My parents, my mother and my father. A it's great. Tell me about something you have done recently that you really enjoyed. B recently. What did I do? New Year's party. I had time for my life. It was so fun. To I would love to know more. B This New Year's Eve, I went to a party with a friend in the Baldwin Hills region. He had it in a pretty house. It is a three-story house and it was like 350 people in there. It was quite fun. But it was not fun either because it was so many people and you couldn't really move. So it was the only fall. But in addition to that, I brought my new year with tons of friends and that's how it is supposed to be done. A great. What are the things that you usually put in a good mood? B I am generally in a good mood every day. I mean, waking up puts me in a good mood. I guess you could say that, but I don't know. A good meal. A it's so good to hear. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B One of my most memorable experiences was probably when I was younger. I was in Boy Scouts and we used to camp all the time. And a year, we went to Yellowstone or Yosemite, one of these places. And we had to work on a mountain bike badge. And of course, being from the city, I am like mountain biking. I can do mountain bikes. But once we entered the real mountains and we went up on real mountain bikes, I won a W Respect for mountain bikers. It was pretty. It was fun and quite intense. In descent, making about 45 miles per hour in dirt on a bicycle was quite intense. I will never forget that. What are you most proud of in your life? B I don't know. It is difficult to answer. What am I the most proud of? I don't know. Honestly. A good. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye.

"A good, so let's see. Move this and I'm going. I would probably put the chair in the wrong place, so I'm just going to make you go back just a little, if you don't mind. B like that? One yeah. Because we want to see your hands. Okay, perfect. I think it looks good. B ok. A good. B I know it's a bit. She looks weird. She looks real, however. An oh, good.

B then. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. Today. My daughter's birthday today. In AW, it's great. B Where do you originally come from? California. A really? B yes. What are the things you really like at? B The beach. I love waters. What are the things you don't really like at it? B Gang violence. Violence? Can you tell me? B I lost many friends who grew up. By primary and high school. Just lose them through the violence of gangs. Sorry to hear that. B Yeah, thank you. It's quite difficult there. Yeah, I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B has not yet gone to a place in California, so not really. A good. What do you study at school? B I am optician. I am a certified optician and I also have my associate diploma. Who seems interesting. How did you decided to do this? B In fact, I entered. I didn't really know what I wanted to do when I applied for the first time. I just knew that I wanted to change my life and make something successful before I settle and now do my daughter and everything. In fact, my guidance advisor helped me. And I have always thought like, they were so cool because they are white and long laboratory bodies. What is your dream work? B to be an optometrist. One why? B because I am already optician and it's like the first step. And why was a good question. Is because then I could have had my own business and I would have something to leave to my daughter R and she would really have nothing to want. It would be like a family business, but to help the community too and something I can leave for my daughter. Who makes sense. Tell me about your children. B my daughter, she is five years old. She will start primary school next week and today is her birthday. Five years ago, I got it. She is very intelligent. I taught him the house. I educated her for five years. And she is adorable. She is my heart. R Do you find easy to be a parent? B no. It's like the most difficult work of all time. It is very difficult to provide. Supply. Make sure you wash their clothes because, I mean, it is quite difficult to be a parent. But I am a young parent and I am a little more mature than his father. So that's. This is the providing part. I would essentially say by ensuring that you have everything they need. It's so complicated, and even less that it gives you the enthusiasm to be more. To make an additional effort. I myself here today, I would probably have been in bed, but today, my daughter's party and I was trying to earn a very small additional money that I could win, you know, to make sure she has a good day. It is therefore a question of making an additional effort, of doing everything you can do to provide them. But it is a very difficult job. What is the best thing to be a parent? B This moment of the day when your child tells you how much they care about you. And my daughter, her favorite thing to tell me, is that I am her heart, you know, and when they call your name, it is a sense of reality. So we called mom or we called dad, and it's as if that brought you. It also allows you to know, like, it is reality. It's my life. This is what I'm going through at the moment. And it's a very good feeling. This is the best part of being a parent. A it's so good to hear. B Thank you. What are the ways that you are different as a parent than your parents? B Many different things. I take care of my daughter. I'm here with her. I was raised by my grandparents, so I mean, I didn't really do it. I did not know my mother until the age of 16. And my father, I mean, I could not report it or the street on the sidewalk, so I don't know who it is. So I think that I am very different from them because it does not matter the difficulty of work, I do not give up. One yeah. B yeah. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B I would say there were. Excuse me. There were many different people who have been very positive in my life. I can say my sister . She had a good influence on me to enter the medical field. It is a LVN and it is one of my older sisters. I can say I believe in God, be in my life. God being in my life also kept me hard. And know that I don't have to take this world by myself because God is there for me. And I don't know. I don't really look at many different people because people lie. It is therefore the most that I can think that it was positive for me. A good. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I think I'm out. I was shy to come when I was a child, and I don't know. I don't know what happened to me. One day, I just got out of my shell and I was very precise to show my personality. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I really like the waves to collapse against the rocks and at the beach. And I just would like to sit there and just zié everyone who is there and rub my toes in the sand, and it's so relaxing. How are you going to control your temperament? B Excuse me. Sorry for that. I learned that because it is a form of knowledge that controls and is it your life or is it someone else? And I feel that my temperament, I control my temperament shows that I am in charge of my life. So I don't even let the things reach me. I don't even remember the last time I had to control my temperament because it is how much I try to block negativity. A it's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B probably my husband, my daughter's father, probably finished, like, oh, you know, the dishes are like little things, but not a physical altercation as with another human. Me? One no. All right. What do you feel guilty? B WOW. Being honest, I feel somehow guilty of the way things, as, fundamentally, how things ended before my mother's passage. I want me to have helped him a little more. Even if people told me not to feel bad because she was not really there for me growing up. But I felt somehow guilty, as, you know, not being there as much as I could have been for her before her death. So I think it's something that I still feel guilty. A good, tell me about an event or something you want to be able to erase from your memory. B passing through my mother who dies. How did you feel at that time? B I felt like. I felt like it was the case. I fe Lt in a way stolen in a sense. As if I felt that everyone had parents and I grew up with my grandparents. And then for me to go there so many years without mom and dad, for me, so that I am 18 years old, then she leaves me, it was a bit like, I do not know, it was a nerve that developed because I felt stolen, you know, it was as if I had not all these years, and then that I am older and I don't even have it. SO. One yeah. I'm sorry. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to make. B UM, sign the paper to have a C section while it was time for me to have my daughter.

B It was the safest way to bring my daughter to this world. Are you happy that you did that? B yes. A it's good. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B it's hard. I didn't even sleep last night. That's why I'm yarning. But I tend to try to do everything and I have to come back to this stage where I also have to think of myself, give myself time. How are you when you don't sleep well? B a bit like that. But in fact, I'm a little nicer today. Just groggy. A good. How do you feel recently? B The last times, I felt very confident to be positive to make an additional effort to be a good parent. A it's great. Have you noticed changes in your behavior or in a thoughtful manner? B uh, yeah. In fact, I really don't care what others think. I used to let it bother me. I am no longer. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B oh, today. Because I was so happy to have brought my daughter into this world today on her birthday. One huh. What would you say that some of your best qualities are? B get to know people. Is there something you regret? B not the moment. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?

"A But when you deal with humans, you got to deal with feelings and emotions. Not with this, though. B All right, so she's going to come in here, she's a fly in, and then shake her back down. And then I'm just going to adjust this just a little so it's not so ridiculous. A All right? B Okay. Now I'll start her up. And she's done. She's going to say goodbye. A All right? All righty. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. A Hi, Ellie. B To talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Yes, I am. B Okay. So how are you doing today? A Outstanding. B Where are you from originally? A Syracuse, New York. What are some things you really like about LA weather? The what are some things you don't. B Really like about la? A Traffic and crime? B Do you travel a lot? A No. B Why? A Well, I did most of my traveling in the military, so I been around the world twice already, so I seen all I need to see. B What's one of your most memorable experiences? A Hiroshima Memorial in Hiroshima, Japan. Seeing people that survived the bomb attack that had disfigured parts on their body etched in my brain forever. B What did you study at school. A In the military? Aviation ordinance. B What do you do now? A I'm a disabled veteran waiting on a pension and whatever I can do to make money legally. B What's your dream job? A Caddying for Tiger Woods. B Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A Outgoing, but I am shy in some areas. B Tell me about your relationship with your family. A Almost non existent. But there is communication. B Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? A Walk. Walked down North Broadway in East Los Angeles. B How are you at controlling your temper? A Pretty good. I've been known to fly off the handle, but the older I get, the less I do it. B When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? A Maybe about a week ago and it was over Internet usage. B Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. A Whatever comes to your mind. Jumping to conclusions on certain things with my girlfriend. Sometimes I struggle with mental health issues due to the military. And sometimes I say the wrong thing or I make false accusations and assume things. But I never Let it get too far. B What's something you feel guilty about? A A lot of things that I've said that I didn't really mean to say. Probably from being paranoid about things and. Yeah. B Tell me about the hardest decision you ever had to make. A Whether where I was going to live after I was discharged from the military. B Served in the military? A Yes. B How old were you when you joined the military? A 18. B Why did you decide to enlist in the military? A My brother was a sergeant major active in the military and my parents had both deceased. And I basically had nowhere to go upon graduation from high school. Grew up fast. B Are you happy you did that? A Yes. I sad I got out. I should have stayed in 20 years. I was in a combat situation twice. I was in the United States Marine Corps and I was activated for attack on Libya and it never transpired. President Reagan canceled it. And I was also recalled for the Gulf War to work on the 20 millimeter guns. And I was on an LPH, a naval vessel, fairly close to the combats in the Middle east and the Persian Gulf. B All right. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? A Pretty easy. At first. I was angry, man, when I. When I made the adjustment, but I had a heavy drinking problem and it was. It was. It was a. It was an experience, a traumatic one at that. But, you know, I pulled through. B I'm sorry to hear that. A Not all that bad. B What did you do after the military? A I worked for some biomedical corporations and software manufacturing companies as shipping and receiving, inventory analyst, material handler, stuff like that. I also worked part time as a security guard and a lot of different things. Yeah. B Okay. How did serving in the military change you? A Gave me discipline, gave me some good qualities like punctuality and attention to detail. And fear no one fear no man. B Okay. How have you been feeling lately? A Good lately. But I struggle with mental health issues like adhd, depression, ptsd. B Have you noticed any changes in your behavior lately? A They've been more positive. A little bit more positive. I'm not. It's pretty hard. Pretty hard. It takes some Schedule 2 narcotics, amphetamines for the ADHD, so that doesn't help. And I basically, I pass out more than I fall asleep. B What are you like when you don't sleep? A Well, I've learned to deal with it. Okay. I'm not grouchy or irritable. I just. If I don't have anything nice to say, I don't say anything at all. But there was times when I was a little edgy. B All right. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? A Yes, one time. B How long ago were you diagnosed? A 10 years ago. 15 years maybe. B What were your symptoms? A Heavy dream activity, reliving experiences that were in the past. Not being able to fall back asleep and fits of rage. Unconscious fits of rage and stuff like that. B Are they triggered by something? A Combat training in the Marine Corps and actual. Almost entering a situation like that is pretty traumatic. Even though you don't enter the situation, the training up to that point is safe. And then all of a sudden you have to use what you were trained in, a safe environment and take it into an unsafe environment is pretty traumatic. Fear of the unknown. It's not so much anymore. Time heals everything. I'm a firm believer of that. And I actually had a dream just recently about. About it. And it's been the first one I've had in maybe a year or two. It's subsiding slowly. B What got you to seek help? A The va when I. When I first went to get primary care and they looked at my file and thought maybe I should be examined. B All right. Do you still go to therapy now? A No, I don't. Not for ptsd, No. I was going to some classes briefly. B Why did you stop? A It wasn't really an issue with me anymore. I'm coping with it well. And it's like I said, time heals everything. I do believe that. And it's. The nightmares are few and far between now and I'm comfortable without it. B I'm sorry. A Wasn't your fault. B Do you feel therapy is useful? A Yes, if your heart's in it. B Can you tell me about that? A Well, if you're forced to do something, you're not really going to put your heart into it. But if you really want to seek help and you really want, really want something, you'll try to get it from your heart. B What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? A I'm more. I eat better, I take care of my physical and mental health needs better. And I don't avoid doctors or hospitals anymore. I go and get help. B When was the last time you felt really happy? A Today. B Can you tell me about that? A Well, I've been in a relationship now for about six months. I'm 50 years old and she's 23. And it makes me young again, kind of. And I've got a good woman by my side now. I was alone for many years, so it's a good feeling. B Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? A Social workers and doctors at the va that. That treat you with respect and genuinely try to help you. B How would your best friend describe you? A Someone who never let him down. B Tell me about something you did recently. Recently that you really enjoyed. A Nice. B What are you most proud of in your life? A Serving my country and getting honorable discharge. B Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. A All right, my pleasure, Ellie. Bye.

"A I'm also gonna do something that looks even funnier. All right. Okay, so now I'm gonna start the virtual human up and I'll hand you the doorbell when you're done. B Okay? Hmm. A Hi, I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confident. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I didn't get much sleep last night and it's cold and I'm just gonna get through the day. Haven't showered in two days. I need to just change my clothes and get a haircut and get myself together. Get more awake. Huh. A That sucks. B Okay, I know. A Where are you from originally? B New Jersey. A Really? Why'd you move to LA? B This was 30 years ago. My cousin went out here and said I might as well go. Nothing happening here in Jersey City. I'll come out. That was in. A Is it for you to get used to living in la? B Very easy, Very easy. Just like, you know, you find your 9 to 5 job to pay the rent and a lot of things to do here. A What are some things you really like about la? B Probably the film industry and the celebrities and glamour and excitement. Yeah, I fit in real good. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B Hmmm. Hmm. Wow. Oh, well, just like probably the homeless problem, but you gotta see the derelicts and they eat out of the garbage and you know, we're the homeless capital of America and you gotta see this all over the place. A I see what you mean. What did you study at school? B I just graduated high school, but I have an interest in writing, you know. A What made you decide to do that? B What made you decide? No, I have an interest in reading and words and creating stories and being imaginative. But I haven't written anything in in a while. That's my drug. I don't drink or smoke or do any of these kind of drugs, but writing was always what got me high. A That's good. B Yeah, but I haven't been inspired. But I recently just met a young girl who's a stand up and her routine is so interesting. I could write a novel of her routine. Anyway, tell me about that. Oh, I don't know, actually Facebook. She told all this stuff about how she's friends with a homeless woman and a homeless woman can inherit $4 million if she gets off the street. And she has an autistic sister who's very strange but is crazy about guys. And she's like 20 and wants to be a comic. And she's really talented. I've been Facebooking her, but she hasn't responded. Okay. A Do you consider yourself an introvert? B Probably. Yes. Yes. A Why? B Trying to think, what does introvert mean? Yeah, well, I keep. Do I keep everything inside of me? Probably, yeah. And I'm always thinking, probably all the time thinking about my problems and just too much analyzing. Yeah. A What are some things that make you really mad? B Probably lazy people, people just living off the government, going to get their section A. They just don't go out and just work and fend for themselves and just take care of themselves. Make me mad. Just people who just so lazy. And some that go, they walk, they're in the traffic with their signs, give me money. Please help me. Please help me. Help yourself. Help me, Help me. That's what makes me mad. I try to just deal with it and try to just because I don't like being annoyed or angry. I don't really curse that much. I try to just stay calm, intelligent. So I just try to deal with it and suppress it and work through it. A How are you at controlling your temper? B I'm okay, but lately I have had outbursts and I regret it only probably due to lack of sleep or just tension that's rising and problems going on. But I try to just stay calm. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Oh, oh, wow. I don't like to argue, but I was arguing with a girl who was working at a movie theater and she was giving people wrong directions on which line to stand on. And she was causing, like, hassles. And I was saying, you know, they have to stand over here and don't send them over there. They won't get into the film screening. And there was some argument going on. And of course I was in the right. She was giving wrong information. This was at Grauman's Chinese Theater. A Okay. How close are you to your family? B Well, I do have a twin brother that I live with, but we don't get along. We're total opposites. I have a sister I haven't seen or talked to probably in 18 years. I have a younger brother. Don't see him much. And what's sad, just have a mother who's still around. She's like 70, 75, probably in the last three years. Just no communication, no phone. Calls. No Facebooking. Just separated. It's like we don't interest each other. A Why? B It's the way that she's always. I don't. Well, never had a father. The father left when I was 4. And she's always been a housewife, always getting. She's always been on welfare and food to dams. She never really worked. I just wish she did something more. She just, you know, I do love her, but we don't have a relationship anymore. A Yeah, I understand. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Who's been a positive influence? Probably good writers. Probably some of my favorite authors who inspire me to write better. I like the writer, like William Goldman. He's a very good writer. And he wrote Marathon man and he writes about how to write screenplays, and he wrote the Princess Bride. He's been an inspiration. A Nice. What do you think of today's kids? B What was that? A What do you think of today's kids? B Today's kids? Oh, just. I can answer that with two, three words. Well, just two aspects. It's just too much. Too much video games, too much technology, too much skateboarding. Just. It was better in the 70s. When I grew up, we didn't have to. We weren't locked in rooms or sitting in front of screens for hours and hours and hours, so. And everyone's. Yeah, this is 2013. It's. Everyone's just trying to, you know, life is hard for everybody, and everyone's just trying to get through it. It's tough. A How would your best friend describe you? B Generous and funny and fun to be with and just an all around great guy. A Have you ever served in the military? B No. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed by? Six years ago. A What got you to seek help? B I probably just. When I probably went to. Probably. I went to a free clinic. Things were bad. I was probably interested in medication, and then when they offered it to me, I decided not to deal with it. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't want to take medication or anything. I was taking Lipitor for high cholesterol and getting too much side effects. Fatigue and sleeplessness and dizziness. I won't take medication. A Did you think you had a problem before you found out? B Because I'm a creative person and I've just suffered depression probably all my life. I have my highs and my lows. Oh, man. Just feeling blah. Just walking around and just not feeling anything. Not feeling Good about anything or excited about anything. Just bored. So bored all the time. A How have you been feeling lately? B Lately, probably I never felt so bad in my entire life. Probably last few years have just been really bad. I'm in survival mode about it. It's pretty bad. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B I've just become a boring person. I go to all these free events all the time trying to save money. I'm out every night. I'm rarely ever home. Out all the time going to events, having a good time then. But it's like I'm just trying to shut out life. I live in movie theaters, just trying to just block everything out. That's not good. A Do you still go to therapy now? B No. A Why did you stop? B Wasn't really into therapy, but. But you know, again, he was a Korean guy, just said, yeah. Your depression. You have suffered depression. I may even be bipolar, but, you know, I'll deal with it. A Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Well, believe it or not, if it's just dark and quiet, I'll sleep pretty good. Eight to ten hours sometimes because I snore. Sometimes I'm not allowed to sleep. Sometimes I get kicked out of the apartment. It's a small apartment. And I know I've slept on alleyways. I've slept, you know, in doorways just to experience it. I'm not homeless because, you know, that's when I can't sleep. That's when I get two or three hours. So there's your answer. Inside, I can sleep okay because I'm always fatigued. I'm very tired. And I'm a heavy snorer. I snore like a chainsaw. So there you have it. A What are you like when you don't sleep? Well. B I'm okay. I mean, I'm just. People can tell I'm just drowsy and just probably irritable and just want to just let darkness come and let me just get at least 4, 5, 6, somehow some sleep at all. Please. If I get some, then I'll be okay. A Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? B Okay. I would say that I had a gambling. I had a gambling addiction which kind of messed my whole life up, you know? Pretty much lost everything. When was the last time I was happy? I probably took $60 to a casino, turned it into $1,200. So the next. Well, so I had $1,200 in my pocket. Well, it was exciting. But of course, the next few days that $1,200 was liquidated. It went because I was stupid and got greedy. But that's when I'm happiest. Probably go to a casino and win or just stay even and not lose anything. That's where my adrenaline is. A Has that gotten you in trouble? B Yes, it has. It got me. Put me where I am today. Too much blackjack. It's bad. But otherwise, in the past three years, I haven't had, you know. No, I don't. Not much. I don't gamble. The gambling is not worth it. In the end, you lose everything. Yeah. A I'm sorry. B Yeah, apology accepted. A Qualities. B I am generous. I'm very, you know, I'm a nice guy. I'm not going to do you wrong. And I'm very reliable all around. Good guy. I'll help you out. I'll lend you a few dollars. I think I'm all right. No, nothing at. I just hope. I just hope, you know, that there is a second chapter in my life at my age. We'll see. Right now, I'm just floundering, killing time. Probably. Probably been four years now, just of nothingness. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Say that again. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Managing money better. I would never think I would have six figures in the bank, but I did. But a lot of it, it evaporated very slowly. So that advice is probably just don't. Don't gamble. Keep your money. Try to find some other means of excitement. But for me, being at that blackjack table with big wages was my reality. That reality was better than being outside the casino. My reality was right there. Now, Texas hold'em. I did okay. I didn't lose much. I'm a pretty good player. Blackjack, it just took everything. A What are you most proud of in your life? B That I had those 12 years. I owned a casting company for 12 years and provided people for movies and television shows and a lot of audience work. So I made a lot of money for 12 years and traveled, had the time of my life. So at least on my deathbed, I can say from 96 to 2008, I had 12 years that I never thought I would ever have, ever have. Just money. Money that I really enjoyed. My excitement is going. Is getting into a big movie premiere at the Gromit. It's free, and you get the popcorn and soda and you see the stars. That's about as exciting as it's gonna get right now. A Awesome. B Okay. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B All right. Take care.

There, that's fine. B agree, great. A now we can start. When it is over, can you just ring the doorbell and let me know? Yeah. THANKS. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Consider me a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I am a computer. I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. How are you today? B I'm fine. Where are you from? B from Los Angeles, California. A beautiful. What are the things you really like? B Le Temps Frais, Les Plages, People, School. Schools. What are you studying at school? B Child development. A beautiful. Do you still do that? B yes. What is your dream work? B to be a teacher for special education. How difficult? B This is not difficult because I like to work with children. A really? B yes. What are the things that make you really crazy? B Dishonna, maybe. Can you give me an example? B as if a guy, like. Especially when it comes to relationships, when they lie to you about something very minimal. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? My mom. B I want to see my mom. An AW. How close to them are you? B I am very close. We speak every day. A it's so good to hear. How far are you from your family? B very close. Even if I don't live with them, I try to see them as much as possible. How do you like your life situation? Uh, that's fine. B is. It's cool. It's good. Do you have roommates? B Yes, I do it. By telling me more about it. B um, they are. They are friendly. It's just that they are very calm, so I'm not used to this environment. A OH. What is it to live with them? B is good. Like, the. How cheap it costs, so it's good. And they are friendly, so it's okay. I just want it a bit. It could have been better. SO. Yeah. R could you have done something to avoid it? B yes. Could you say a little more about it? B I had a different option to live with someone else, and I am always friends with the woman. And come to discover that we connect more than the roommates with which I live. So I regret moving to the roommates that I have now against whom I was supposed to move in at the beginning. But I am stuck for a year. So that's. Anyway, it's good. How do you know them? B How to know who? Let's go back to that. One minute. B yeah. What are the things that make you really crazy? B There is nothing that makes me really crazy that I could think above my head. To everything that comes to mind. B Maybe with schools, how they treat children, especially colored children, that may be what drives me crazy. A good. Do you consider yourself introverted? B yes. One why? B because I do things from the inside. I suppose that I am motivated internally to do things, I suppose. Yeah. Do you often feel this way? B yeah. A good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B WOW. I almost never argue with someone. A really? B yeah. Oh, my sister, I guess my sister. It was about a month ago. How did you feel at that time? B I felt very betrayed and lowered because she is my little sister and she should not lack respect in any way because I am an adult. So, yes, I did not feel the situation at all. Can you tell me? B just his adult belongings. And it was a conversation between me and my mother, and I guess she heard what was said and she felt through my actions that I chose someone else rather than my family when it was not even the case. But because she did not know the whole situation, she automatically supposed and automatically put things on Facebook on me on me, I was missing, calling me my name, and that was. Yeah. SO. And she didn't come to see me about it. Like, she just did all these other things on Facebook. I don't know. This is something that I don't like, it is when you hate indirect comments. As if you have done. If you need to talk to me, come and tell me directly. Do not put it on Facebook, tell other people. It is a dwarf beast for pets. I really don't like it. Yeah, it sucks. B yeah. SO. But I mean, we are well now, so it's good. A it's so good to hear. B yeah. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B so as not to believe people so easily. If gullible. Do not be as gullible. Well, tell me more about it. B I guess I have heard that lately. How I believe anyone. Everything that someone says without really thinking about it or without having it proven. So I guess you could say that I made a lot of mistakes. I don't want To say that I regretted it because I am happy to have lived it while I was younger than to age and to go through the same situation. So, yes, I think people too easily, and I give people too much chance, therefore. Yeah. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B When I had a cruise, which was a happy experience, when I had a cruise in Mexico with my family at the age of 16, about six years ago. A wow. B yeah. A it's long. B yeah. I mean, yes, I suppose. R do you travel a lot? B no. I really want, however. What do you like in travel? B Try new things, see new views about the world, try the different types of food, see how the government is and how they manage things. I guess I would like to hear this during your travels. Yeah. I intend to go to the Bahamas next year. I intend to make a lot of trips last year, in fact, therefore. Yeah. Do you have a good sleep night? B It's pretty good, a bit. How are you when you don't sleep well? B I'm tired, and I fall asleep during the classroom and so on. Do you often feel this way? B yeah. It's my fault, however. When was the. When will it go up the last time it happened? B probably today. A wow. B yeah. One why? B Well, I fell asleep late, so it's my fault. A good. Do you feel depressed? B No, I feel pretty happy at the moment. A it's good. MM. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you ever served in the army? B no. A ok. How would your best friend describe you? B very friendly and funny. Talkative. How do you know them in high school. How much do you have? B We are quite close. We try to speak as often as possible, maybe once a week. Try to see them at least every few months. A it's good. What do you think of today's children? B They are everywhere. Yeah. No comments from this. They are smarter. They learn more than what we learned at the time. They learn. They progress very. But when it comes to technology, they are not outside. They are still on the computer, on their phones. They no longer play outside. They do not care about nature or the little things in life. They are fair. Yeah. But with regard to their mentality, they become smarter because schools improve. I'm not going to lie. So yes. R when is the last time that happened? B when what happened? A I am not sure. Let's go back to that later. When will go back the last time you felt Then happy? B last weekend, I guess. I would love to hear everything right now. What did I do? Being on my boyfriend makes me really happy. So I was lying with him last weekend and I never really see him, then. Yeah. One why? B because he works. I. I have school, different times. Who seems really difficult. B It's not so bad. How do you know them? B he is my boyfriend. I have known him since, what, six months now? We met through a friend common to IDA. A great. All right. I think I lost everything I need. All right. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. B nothing. A farewell. B bye. It is not supposed to arrive. No. How long? B all the time. But I was able to speak to him. A good, good. I'm really sorry. B is good. Was she moved and everything? A was her. B No, she just wanted to stay there, then. A good. Sorry.

"How long are you going to do this? B The study? Yes, until I think next week, then we're going to start another in a few weeks. An oh, really? So should I look?

I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? Sure. C agree. So how are you today? R I'm fine, just a little tired. California. C really? A yes. Time? Not last week, but yes, time. What are the things you don't really like at it? A fear of earthquakes. C I see what you mean. What are you studying at school? A psychology. C do you still work in there? A I am. I go to Harbor College. Are you happy that you did that? A I am. I would have liked to go there earlier, but better late than never. C yeah. What is your dream work? One probably. I'm not sure. I never really thought about it. I want to work in the field of psychology, but I don't know if I want to work with children or adults. So I haven't really decided. C agree. Do you travel a lot? A n ° C why? R I don't know, I don't do it. Maybe once a year. June, in fact. I went to Orlando, Florida. C great. Do you consider yourself introverted? Sometimes, yes. But not like. I'm sorry. Watch television, read a book, talk on the phone, crazy my mother is in my business. Other than that, I guess the frustrations with my son. C do you find easy to be a parent? No. The most difficult thing is to raise a disabled child, without knowing how you can help him. It seems really difficult. A is. It's very hard. I don't put it sugar at all. This is the best thing about Be a parent? Just have my children. They are a blessing. I love them. With all the good and evil. That's part of me. And I just like the fact that I help to shape them in good human beings. How are you from your family? R We are really close. I mean, my family is little. We live in blocks of each other, but, yes, we are close. C agree. What is one of your most memorable experiences? A good or a bad? The most memorable? I just give birth for the first time. It was simply incredible. My son is 9 years old now, so I still remember it as it was yesterday. How did you feel at that time? As if I was born again. I don't know how to explain it. It's just very emotional. C agree. Is there anything you are. R I don't know. I guess I have a lot of regrets, but none I really want to mention. I guess. Stay at school. Do not get emotionally involved and let people dissuade your goals. Could you have done something to avoid it? A oh, yes, definitely. Did you want me to do it? I'm doing well. I mean, I am quite easy to live for most. I don't really have a temperament in itself. Things frustrate me more than they get me angry. Oh, it's easy. With my mother, she is like, I suppose that the argument comes from me wanting to socialize. She feels that I am married to children, so I should stay at home, like 99% of the time. And I wanted to go out and socialize with former colleagues, and she sort of deposited me, as if I did not spend enough time with my children. This is the case. And I love my mom. I even hate having the thought of being frustrated by her because I always think that, my God, I don't want to get angry with her, then something happens the next day. But it becomes a little intrusive. I don't know. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? A oh, I know. After the end of the semester when I noted that, you know, I did well at school because I had been. It's been a long time since I went to school. So when I received my notes, you know, a and a b, I was like, wow, okay, I can do it. And it made me happy. And it was about a few weeks ago, I guess. THANKS. My mom. I know it's good and bad. I mean, for the most part, my mother had a positive influence. You know, just sometimes, you know, she gets a little, as if she wanted to get me up or something like. She does not understand that I am an adult. I will make my own decisions now and I have to let myself do what I should do. C How do you face them? Lots of heavy breathing. Me me And, I sometimes walk when I am a little frustrated. Anyway, I'm just going to walk, you know, or just try not to think about it. It's good. A thank you. C have you already served in the army? Yes, yes, the navy. I was 19 years old. Yeah. I had no other options. I am. I should probably have stayed a little longer. I have only been for four years, but, you know, I wanted to live life outside the army. So I made my enrollment, then I came out. C How has the army service changed you? To that made me a little more responsible than some of my friends who, you know, did not join the army. I could notice a big difference in terms of, you know, how I live my life and how they live theirs. I just made myself a little more responsible. THANKS. I worked in the medical field for about five years and. Oh, thank you. But it was not for me. I wanted to do something a little different. I didn't want to care for patients. I wanted to work with people, but not necessarily as a care supplier to patients. So I started going to school, then I met my husband. I stopped going to school, I got married and started working in a telecommunications field. And then we know, have designed our child. And after that, you know, that's all. I think I care. Well, I know I am. I am very attentive. You know, I am very honest with a fault sometimes. You know, I try to be as honest as possible with people. Sometimes it could harm their feelings. But, you know, you must be honest. You can't let people think that you know, you don't trust. And yes. Yeah, probably. I never really thought about it. I don't know, maybe I don't really think about it. I'm just trying to be the best possible person, you know, so that's all I can do. I cannot live for what others think. I can only do what I have to do. What are the things that usually put you in a good mood? A UM. I don't know. I never really thought about it. I guess it's just, you know, to be with my children, you know, I just like to be with my children. It always puts me in a good mood. THANKS. All right. As I said, a little tired, you know, but you know, for the most part. All right. You know, I am different from different situations. Well, I'm going to bed very early. So as long as I go to bed early, I have a good night's sleep. But I wake up early too. So it's a bit like entering a bit. I'm going to bed like 8, 8:30 am, then I wake up at 1:10 am. So much bad humor, very irritable, short. Short temperate D, I suppose. C have you noticed these changes in your behavior or your thoughts lately? R If anything, I think I think more positively. You know, as I said, especially with my son with a handicap, you know, I look at him as if, you know, it's not that bad. I mean, he has challenges, but I am much better faced. You know, instead of feeling sorry for him or feeling sorry for me. You know, I just find more ways to work with him. You know, different resources to help him, instead of simply feeling guilty or sad and depressed on this subject. THANKS. C have you received a diagnosis of depression? One not occasionally. Who does he do it? C proud of your life? R I don't know. Can we ignore this question? Green seems to be the word. A bit like. Yeah, probably green. Like a little naive. But at the same time intelligent. I think she will describe me as intelligent. It's great. A thank you. C I think I asked for everything I need. A good. C thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. A problem without problem. C goodbye. A bye. Oh, it's true. I have to press the button. It was good. I sort of jumped a question, however. B Very good.

"A Okay, great. Okay, so let me just check your microphone. I think it looks good. B Oh. A Now I'm going to give you the doorbell. B Okay. A When she, when she's done, she'll let you know and you can press that button. B Okay? A Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yeah. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm okay. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B Burbank, California. A Really? B Yeah. A What are some things you really like about la? B The weather, of course. I think everyone likes likes the weather. It's not too city like Chicago or New York. It's big enough. We have beaches. We're not landlocked. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B Sometimes the smog, the traffic. The fact that I've just been here like my entire life almost. A Okay. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B Not enough as I'd like to. I go to school in Chicago and I've been to New York a couple times. San Francisco. And I took a road trip across the country that was cool. I saw a couple states. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Seeing new places, going to landmarks that I've only read about or seen pictures of. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B I traveled from Los Angeles to Chicago taking Route 66. And the best part was seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time. It was the coolest thing I've ever seen. Probably awesome. A How did you feel in that moment? B Happy. And then just happy. It was beautiful. It was nice. I haven't felt like that in a long time. A That's so good to hear. What did you study at school? B I was studying film. A Cool. How did you decide to do that? B It's just something I've always loved for as long as I could remember. And when it came time to start applying to schools, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do and I applied to Northwestern as a film student and it just ended up being the right decision. A That's great. What's your dream job? B Ooh, I love making movies, but part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera. So a comedian, a comedic actor would be totally great, but that's hard. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I am super outgoing, and I love talking to people a lot. I like being the center of attention usually. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I like to watch mindless television, like Toddlers and Tiaras and Duck Dynasty. Just TV programs where I really don't have to pay attention at all. A Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? B I'm okay at it. I get really emotional really fast, but I'm usually able to keep my anger down and not, like, lash out at others and stuff, for the most part. A Has that gotten you in trouble? B Sometimes I get into, like, arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily. And I hate apologizing to people, so the fights could last pretty long. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B My best friend, Ryan, I think. And it was about our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and crossed some lines and where. How we were gonna go back to the way it was before. A How hard is that? B Really hard. It's. He's my best friend, and I miss him, but we messed up, and it's just. It's not the same. It's like, not the same friendship. A I'm sorry. B Me, too. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Too many. Um. I guess when I have a boyfriend and he's a girlfriend, which was not okay. I wish I would have just realized that this was bad and just would have stopped there and not have let it continue for weeks, which led to my breakup and then our friendship being really messed up. A Could you have done anything to avoid it? B I guess not. Spend as much time with him as I did. Being more assertive. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B I guess it was in November. I was very depressed and suicidal, so I told my friend what I was feeling and that she needed to take me to the er. And from the er, I had the choice to, I don't know, I guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital. And even though I felt like I didn't have a choice, I knew it was my choice, and I decided to go to the mental hospital, which was, like, the worst experience of my life ever. A Can you tell me about that? B Um. God, it was Awful. It was in Chicago, and it was scary, and I didn't know anyone, and they just, like, take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs, and they just start giving you medication, and you're basically left to your own devices. There were only, like, three group therapy sessions a day, and everyone there was mostly men, and they were all really old, and it was scary. I didn't know anyone. Everyone. Most of the people there weren't depressed. They were violent. So that was pretty scary. And I just. It was really hard for me. A What made you decide to do that? B I had been so depressed for, like, a month. I stopped going to my classes and work, and I told my teachers lies about being sick, and I just kept calling in sick to work. I dropped a class, and I was failing my classes and not turning in any work, and I wasn't talking to any of my friends, and I was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere, and I was just in a really bad place. And when I finally was gonna kill myself, I realized I needed help. A That sounds really hard. B It was. A What got you to seek help? B Um, I had severe depression when I was a younger teenager, and I tried to kill myself then. And I got put in therapy for quite some time. So I figured, I don't want to go down that bad path again. I just want to get better. So I had to do it. I had to get help. A Do you still go to therapy now? B I do. I go once a week. A Do you feel like therapy is useful? B I feel like if you have the right therapist, it's really useful. I had one therapist that I really liked, and I thought we could have gone really far. But sadly, she's back in Chicago and I'm in Los Angeles. So I have to. I have to make do with this new therapist. And she's okay. She's not. We're not that great together, but she's who I have right now. It's better than nothing. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Not that easy at all. A Why? B Ever since I got out of the hospital and start and I began medication for my depression, I just haven't been able to sleep. Well. Falling asleep is hard. Staying asleep is hard. Have really crazy, vivid dreams that wake me up and are disturbing. A Like what? B Um, I guess just sometimes they reflect things that I'm worried about are happening in my life, but they're just. They're scary and they seem so real that sometimes I wake up and I have to ask my mom, like, did we go here. Did we do this? Did this really happen? And it's usually no. You dream that sometimes I've gotten so scared. I, like, talk in my sleep and wake myself up. A When was the last time that happened? B Probably like two nights ago. A Wow. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B That is a hard question. I think in November, after I got out of the hospital, I finally had one good day and my friend took me into downtown Chicago and we went to the Sears Tower and got to look over those big windows that you walk out on and see the city. And that was really cool. A How would your best friend describe you? B Um, probably super outgoing, likes to be the center of attention. Funny and a little bit crazy. A Is there anything you regret? B I try not to regret things in my life. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B I would say that living is worth it. And just don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Don't wait until it gets really bad. A Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B I guess my ideal weekend would be sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends, maybe going home with them and bake some cookies, eat all the cookies, watch some tv, have a sleepover, and then, like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies. We watch a lot of movies. I would like to do that in my free time. Go for a walk, I don't know, go to the beach. That is a hard question. I mean, I think I've done a lot of great things in my life and I've achieved a lot. But I think one of the proudest things, proudest moments in my life is something really small and insignificant. I was doing this exercise, boot camp, and the last person to cross the finish line had to do 30 push ups. And it was some guy. I didn't really know him at all. And the trainer said, does anyone want to help him? If someone helps him, you have to do half each. And no one wanted to help him. And then I just decided to start doing push ups with him. And I just. It wasn't because I wanted to get credit or because I thought it would make me look good. I just did it. And no one really knows about that, but it just. I feel really good about that. A That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with. B It was nice to meet you. Bye.

"A Okay, so she's going to ask you some questions and then when she's done, she'll let you know. She'll say goodbye, and then you can press this button to let me know that you're done. B Okay? A Okay. B All right, great. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes, I'm fine. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing very well today. I feel good today. Born in Indiana, grew up in Bloomington. I moved to LA for a job working with the cdc. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B I've only been back twice in the past 20 years. A Why? B My family's not there anymore. I went back for high school reunions. A How does it compare to la? B It's much greener. It's very green, very small, very wooded areas. That's where I played in the woods when I was a kid. We swim in the quarries. I rode my bicycle everywhere and here it's a little more cement and traffic. A How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B It just seemed like cement at first, but I love it now and I have friends and I love being able to do so many different things. And I go to the beach a lot. I also go up to the mountains. I go camping all the time, so I love it. I love it. Always opportunities. A I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B I have traveled quite a bit. I was in the Peace Corps and I was in South America. I was in Paraguay for three years and I traveled all through South America. Brazil, Peru, Chile, Bolivia. I also spent a year in London, traveled all through Europe and I used to go to Canada often. I'd love to get to Asia one of these days. A Wow. What do you enjoy about traveling? B Meeting new people, the food. I love trying new food and just getting a different perspective on the world and different people's outlook on the world because America tends to become isolated. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B I hiked the Inca Trail when I was in Peru. That was a five day hike starting out of Cusco. We hiked for I think four or five days and woke up the last morning at the Sun Gate of Machu Picchu. And that was just the most amazing experience because I would only. I'd seen about. Seen it in National Geographic, you know, all my life. So to be there and experience that was phenomenal. A Awesome. What did you study at school? B Philosophy. I have my degree in philosophy. I minored in art. Well, I started out in business, and I got very disenchanted with it very quickly, and so I decided to study what I wanted to study while I was in college and had the opportunity. So that's what I wanted to do. And everyone advised me against it because you can't get a job as a philosopher. But I had the idea of getting my philosophy degree, then going to law school and being a professor of ethics, but that kind of fell apart. And that's actually how I ended up joining the Peace Corps. So it all worked out. I'm sorry. Yeah. Sorry, my alarm's going off on my phone. It'll die in a second. Okay, I'm sorry. It's still going. Sorry, I turned off the phone, but I forgot to turn off the alarm. There you go. Okay, well, I'm sorry, what was your question? My dream job. Gosh. Writing. I've done a few scripts, some screenplays with a friend of mine, but I don't really want to do the Hollywood thing. But writing and teaching and traveling, if I could do that overseas. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Outgoing. Should I turn off my alarm? It keeps going here. Oh, I can't move. Okay. I can't get to my purse. Okay, I'm sorry. Yes, I. I turned off my phone, but I didn't turn off the. The alarm is like. I forgot it's my alarm to go to yoga class. I'm terribly sorry about that. Okay. Sorry for the interruption. A Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I have an actual fish tank at my house, and I do the same thing, and I do that with my children. When they get upset, I sit them in front of the fish tank and it is very relaxing. I also try and meditate. I try and just sit down and be quiet and gather my thoughts. I like to read. Or sometimes I walk. I'll take my dog for a walk. A How are you at controlling your temper? B I wish I could say I was good at it, but usually I tend to have outbursts every once in a while when things are getting Too chaotic at my house, and I'm feeling very underappreciated. I will have a burst of anger. Yeah. My husband doesn't appreciate that. And I've never done it at work or in a social situation, but at home with my family, I've done it. And then instead of recognizing that I'm upset about it, my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad. And then that escalates. And sometimes I just. I end up walking out the door or going to my room. Hmm. I'm sorry. A How do you cope with that? B Usually after I have an outburst and I isolate myself for a little bit, I can come back relaxed and deal with the situation in a more calm manner. A How hard is that? B Sometimes it's very hard. But I've gotten to the point where I know just to stop and get myself out of there and go take some deep breaths, and then really try and figure out what I'm feeling, why I'm being angry, why am I being so tense? And then be able to verbalize that. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Well, it happens a few times when I start getting. I've had a very tense day, and things haven't gone right. I tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while I'm making dinner and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework or they're turning on the tv and my husband's bothering me about things that I just don't need to think about right then. And one time I just said, okay, everyone out of the kitchen. Leave me alone. Get out. Just let me finish dinner. And nobody would. And I just had more pressure building up and building up, and actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove really hard to just, like, get people to pay attention to what I was saying. And I actually made a dent in my stove, which is still there, so that I should have walked out sooner and taken my deep breaths before I did that. It was probably when I was pregnant with my first child. I wasn't married. I had a very good friend. I was 32 at the time, so I was. You know, I wasn't young. I think if I was younger, I probably would have decided to have an abortion. But at that point in my life, I'm like, okay, I'm going to have this child. And I had. I got pregnant by the man I actually married and still married to, but we had only been dating, like, three months, and I was living with a good friend of mine. Who I'd been in the Peace Corps with. And she. And so I didn't know this guy very well. I didn't know if we could raise a child together. I didn't know if I wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else. And my friend suggested that we raise the child together. Even suggested moving to Costa Rica to raise the child together. And so it was a lot of huge decisions that were going to determine the rest of my life. And I made the decision based on more common sense and practicality. But I don't regret that decision. I think I made a good decision to marry my husband and raise our child. A Tell me about your kids. B They're older now. My eldest is 17. He is at Da Vinci Science School. He's very much into engineering. He is getting his pilot's license, which I'm very proud of him for then. My daughter is 15 and she loves acting. She has a boyfriend who they see just once a week at church basically and they text each other constantly. She's a very, very typical 15 year old. And then I have a 12 year old. He is extremely active and is in constant motion and always making noises. But I love him dearly. He is into rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our. So he has a membership there. So he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis. A Do you find it easy to be your parent? B No, I find it extremely difficult. I wasn't. My mother had a very. My dad died when I was young and my mother kind of disconnected when that happened. So I didn't have a very warm or loving relationship with my mother or growing up. And I basically raised myself. I was kind of on my own from a very young age. I mean, she was at the house but really I had no interaction with her. So I really didn't have parenting skills that, you know, most people are raised with. I know what not to do, but sometimes it's very, very difficult. And I see my friends that have, you know, these very innate parenting skills. He's very warm and you know, they're making cookies and everything's organic and they knit everything and you know, their house is always perfect and it's like I'm just not that person. So I try and be. I think I am a very good mother. But I'm not a typical mother. I think I'm more. I'm more creative a lot of times and we do a lot of things, but it's not a warm, fuzzy, cozy kind of thing. Actually when we go Camping, it's more. I'm more homey when I go camping than I am at home. I think I'm more tense when I'm at home. But I'm trying to, like, through meditation and things of that sort, I'm trying to become calmer and more patient. I think my patience is what I need to work on the most. I've been an insomniac all my life. I remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across my bedroom window. And I haven't slept well for a long time. But I realized that if I exercise and I do something with my brain intellectually during the day, I have to be physically tired and intellectually tired to sleep well. And that's. Sometimes that's hard to do. And so a lot of times I stay awake reading. I'll read till midnight and then I'll try and go to sleep. And usually I won't get back up, even if I'll wake up at three again and things of that sort. But I'll try to go back to sleep. Yesterday I didn't feel so good. I think a lot of it has to depend on the weather. And it was all cloudy and gray yesterday because I planned on working on my garden. And then I'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard, so I had some more planting to do and I just didn't kind of feel like doing it. So I just sort of piddled about and wasted a lot of time yesterday. But today I feel really good, so I feel more positive, I feel more energy. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B I don't know. I just got a new mattress, actually. That hasn't really helped me sleep. But it was really good because I've needed one for a really long time. And I was just kind of excited about being delivered and set up. And that sounds like, so mundane, but it was, you know, just like, I'm finally doing something positive because it's something that I put off doing and put off doing, put off doing. And it was like, finally there and concrete. And it's like, okay, I've done this task that I can check off my list. But also, I took the kids camping over spring break, and we just had a fabulous time. And we sat around telling stories on the campfire and making s'mores and things like that. And those kind of times make me very happy. A How would your best friend describe you? B I don't know. I think she believes that I'm more intellectual and smarter than I think that I am at times. So she comes to me with a lot of issues. She always solicits advice from me. She thinks I give her good advice, and when she doesn't know what to do, she'll ask me. And then sometimes she just calls me to run things by just like, to complain about because I'm sympathetic or empathetic and I'm just there to listen. And I don't need to give her any advice. So I think a good listener and good advice giver. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B I procrastinate a lot. I start projects and I don't finish them. So that's what I'm working on right now, is finishing up a lot of projects that I've started over the past few months. A lot of them are really creative projects, and I'm very enthusiastic about them. When I start them and I'll get almost finished, and then I don't know what happens. I just completely lose interest. Sometimes I think it's because I'm afraid to finish them, which sounds a little strange, but I'm working on that. I'm trying to get those done. Oh, gosh. Not following through on the opportunities I had. When I got out of the Peace Corps, there was a lot of things that I could go into. I could have gone to get my master's degree on a grant and things of that sort. But instead I got pregnant and got married. And I had a wonderful job that I really liked and really enjoyed. But then when I got pregnant the second time, it was right at a time where I had to fight for a directorship. And I realized my limitations where I couldn't be pregnant and have this child and. And do everything I needed to do to get a directorship. And so I really wish. So I resigned. And I wish I had stuck with that because then I would have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and solid career. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Not to base decisions on emotions. Sometimes I. And not. I've had some really bad bosses. The jobs were wonderful, but my ego got in the way and I would have told myself to let go of that aspect of the job, let go of the. The egotistical reactions that I had to the bosses, and concentrate on the job and doing that really well. My children, actually, and also my Peace Corps experience was just phenomenal. And people are actually really interested in that, and they're, like, in awe that they actually know someone who actually did that. So that's. I always. When I was a little girl, my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the Peace Corps when it first started. And I always said, oh, I want to do that one day. I want to do that one day. I want to do that one day. And then finally I got to the point where I said, I either have to shut up or do it. So that. That was one of my prouder experiences. A That's so good to hear. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. B Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. A Goodbye. B Bye.

"A 20 seconds or more goes by and it's just silence. Go ahead and press that button. It just means something went wrong. I'm hoping that doesn't happen. B Okay. A Just as a fail safe, you can press that if that happened. B Okay. A And I'm going to actually adjust this just a little bit more. Sorry to keep tweaking it there. B That's okay. A So now I'm going to start our camcorder recording and I'm going to bring up our virtual human. Just going to kind of pull it here. There she is. Okay, we can start her up. B Okay. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to Ken in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. B Okay. A Are you okay with this? B Definitely. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing okay. A little tired and I had some pizza, so I'm a little sleepy right now. And other than that I'm doing okay. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B I was born in. So I was raised in la. A Alright. What are some things you really like about la? B Let's see. What do I like about la? I like the beaches, I like the weather. I like the fact that there's a lot of jobs here that there aren't in a lot of other states. Like the beautiful women and that's about it. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B Let's see. I don't like. I don't like the smog, I don't like the overcrowded freeways. I don't like the crime rate, the violence, the. The economy is a little hard to deal with. Things, things of that nature. Yeah. A I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? B I used to. Used to travel all over the place, state to state. I used to be a truck driver at one point, so I used to drive diesel truck. So I've been to a lot of different states, seen a lot of different things, but not so much anymore. I kind of am a homebody now. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B I like seeing. I like seeing new things, new people, new places like the food, the weather, everything. I love just seeing new and experiencing new things. A I'd like to hear about one of your trips. B One of my trips? Let's see, let's see. Actually one of my trips that I've had that was a little interesting. Was. I didn't. Well, besides traveling through the United States was. I went to Mexico. That was kind of interesting. And I didn't have the greatest experience in Mexico because I got, excuse me, I got my car stolen in Mexico. So I wasn't, I didn't have that great of a time there, but I, I enjoyed the Baja. That's where I went was Baja right by Tijuana. Enjoyed the fish there, the tacos, stuff like that. A What are your most memorable experiences? B One of my most memorable experiences. Let's see. A What did you study at school? B What did I study at school? I studied, went for my BSBM degree, but I didn't finish my degree. A What do you do now? B Now I'm a disabled vet. I spent a lot of time writing, poetry writing a number of different things, spending time with family, biking, just enjoying a lot of things, Reading, I love to read, love to spend time with family, things like that. A Uh huh. What's your dream job? B My dream job. Let's see. My dream job, I used to do a lot of workman's comp investigations where I did workman's comp fraud and I checked out people that were lying and supposedly defrauding insurance companies for, for money. And I enjoyed that. I did that for years. That was pretty much my dream job. I loved it. I did surveillance, I did report writing, I did undercover work. I did all kinds of different things at one point. So that would be my dream job. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Right now I feel like I'm outgoing, but generally I'm shy. It comes to social scenes. A lot of times I'm shy, but right now I don't feel shy. Right now I feel comfortable talking to you. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B I was adopted, so my relationship with my family didn't really go that well. So I'm really not close with my adopted family and I have limited biological family, so I don't really have a lot of family. But the very few that I have, I love them very much and I try to spend as much time with them as I can. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I listen to music and I pray. I pray I listen to music and I just meditate on positive things. Take a walk, ride a bike, read a book, things like that. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Didn't used to be very good at it. But throughout the years, going through hard times and learning the hard way, I've learned to control my temper pretty well. Now it takes a lot to get me. To get me angry. I'm more passive now than I ever have been, and I like that about myself. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B I argued with my best friend. Probably wasn't like a real serious argument, but we argued a little bit about religion, which I don't like to go into, or I don't like to get into arguments about, but unfortunately, we got into argument about religion. She wanted me to. She wants me to join her religion. I don't feel like it's what I should do. And so we got into a little dispute about that. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. B Let's see. There's many, many, many situations that I wish I handled differently, and one of them was my children. I wish I could have been. I wish I could have been a better dad to my kids. I wish I could have made better decisions for my children, and I didn't. A What's something you feel guilty about? B I feel guilty about that. About not being a good parent to my kids at many times in my life. And that guilt stays with me my whole life. Every day I think about it. A Mm. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Let's see. The hardest decision I've ever had to make. Tell me about Nicole or something that. A You wish you could erase from your memory. B I wish I could erase from my memory the last time that having getting divorced would be one of the last things. Or the memory of that relationship going bad was probably one of the things of the last. Excuse me. One of the things I'd like to erase from my memory the last time I interacted with my ex wife. A Have you ever served in the military? B Yeah, I was in the Navy. A How old were you when you joined the military? B I was 18. Just a kid. A Why did you decide to enlist in the military? B Well, to be honest with you, I was 18 years old, and I didn't have anywhere else to go. I was homeless, and it was either be homeless on the street at 18 or join the military and try to do something with my life. And so that's what I chose to do. A Are you happy you did that? B Yeah, in a way. Out, you know, I got out. I got out of the military and wish I had stayed in longer. So, yeah, it ultimately, yeah, I'm Glad I did that. A Did you ever see combat? B No, I never saw combat. I was in an 86 and 87 those years, and I was in the Cold War era. I was stationed on the. And my ship was dry docked for a little while, so I didn't see combat. They didn't have combat at that time. A How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? B I think it was too easy for me. I adjusted. Actually, I adjusted real well getting out and getting back into civilian life. I went in with it with both feet running. And so, yeah, it wasn't hard at all. A What did you do after the military? B After the military, I worked several different jobs looking and thinking about what career I wanted to choose. I applied for the sheriff's department. Didn't make the sheriff's department, but got into working for different private investigative companies at that time. And that's how I ended up working and getting into workman's comp fraud and different surveillance and investigative aspects of private investigation. So I worked private investigation a little time after getting out of the military. A How did serving in the military change you? B It taught me honor. It taught me dignity. It taught me respect. It taught me how to listen and obey a chain of command. It kind of grew me up. It grew me up from a kid to a man in a lot of ways. Like I said, I wish I had stayed in longer to have grown more, but I didn't. A How have you been feeling lately? B Lately I've been feeling just really, I don't know, just kind of worthless, you know, Depressed a lot, kind of a little bit worthless. Not. Not feeling like, I don't know, maybe a little lack of hope in a lot of ways, not knowing what my future holds, I guess you could say. And, I don't know, just feeling a little down. In the last couple weeks. A Have you noticed any changes in her behavior or thought process? B Yeah, just feeling kind of hopeless and just depressed and not having a lot of energy and like I said, just feeling down. Just feeling down about myself, not feeling worthy, you know, those kind of feelings. A All right. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Depends on the night. Sometimes I. I sleep really well. Other nights it's restless. I have bad dreams, things like that. But lately I've just been kind of feeling depressed. I've been sleeping too much. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B Sometimes I get irritable. I can't think straight. My mind's a jumble. I just can't think straight. And Irritable and maybe cranky. Things like that. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Yes. Yes. I actually take medication for it. I get counseling for it and I've been dealing with that for a little while now. But yeah, I have been diagnosed with ptsd. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B Excuse me. Several years ago. My earphones coming off a little bit, but yeah, several years ago. A What were your symptoms? B Tremors at night, Nightmares, Depression. Feeling. Feeling something bad is going to happen to me at all times. You know, that's how I felt when I was in the military. I felt like our ship was going to be bombed at any time. Just being. Feeling a sense of terror a lot of the time. A Are they triggered by something? B No. That's the strange part about it. It's just. It's just the way I feel. I don't know why it's like that. I can't tell you. But it's the way I've been feeling for years. Ever since I was in the military. I feel that way now. Like we're going to get bombed. Something's going to happen at any moment. Chaos is going to break out, things like that. And I hate it. I wish it wasn't like that. I wish I didn't think that way. A How do you cope with them? B Isolate sometimes and try to. I pray. I believe in God, so I pray. And I try to get him to comfort me and help me to get through the scary feelings I feel. I try to get support from the little friends I have and a few family members I have. I just try to tell myself everything's going to be okay. It's not what I'm thinking, you know. Things aren't the way I think they are in my head. Those kind of coping mechanisms. A What got you to seek help? B I couldn't take it anymore. I was having depressed. I ended up in the hospital just feeling. Like I said, feeling terror. Being scared all the time. Couldn't. I just couldn't deal with it anymore. So I ended up getting help and I'm glad I did. And it's a day by day struggle. I still struggle every day to just get by. But I basically doing okay. I'm hanging in there. A That sounds hard. B It's very hard. A Do you still go to therapy now? B Yeah, yeah, I go to therapy like probably once a month. I take meds for it. It helps me out a lot. I probably should be going to therapy more, but it's once a month right now. A Alright. Do you feel therapy is useful? B I think it's Useful. If you're serious about it and you take it seriously and you have the right therapist and everything is. The right dynamics are there. I think it's very useful. Yeah. A Tell me more about that. B Well, I think that if you're going just to go, it's not going to help. If you're going to seek the true answers to get help, I think it's going to work. You're going to get help, things will work out. But if you've got the wrong person to talk to, the chemistry's not there or the education or whatever dynamics are involved aren't working. They're not in sync with each other, either on your side or the therapist, it's going to be more difficult for the solution to be a positive one, I think. I don't know. I don't know if I said that properly, but basically, yeah. A What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? B What sort of changes have I noticed? I'm more of a positive person actually than I. Than I ever have been. Was completely negative about everything for so many years. I'm more positive. I have more hope. Even though I have days of hopelessness, I have more hope. I feel more secure within myself and I feel like I've got a release. I've got somebody that I could talk to, that will, that understands me and somebody that I could really relate with. A Okay, when was the last time and you felt really happy? B You know. A Tell me more about that. B I don't remember the last time I was very happy, to be honest with you. I don't remember. It's. I don't remember. It's been a long time. A Who's some of the been a positive influence in your life? B Let's see. My brother, my older brother. He's a real positive influence in my life. My best friend, she's a real super positive person in my life. Every time I start talking negative or looking down on things, she always reminds me, be positive, be positive. And that helps a lot. And she's there to encourage me. And those two people right there play a big role in my life. A How would your best friend describe you? B Oh, boy. I think she'd probably describe me as somebody that needs to take things more seriously when it comes to his health, his spirituality, life itself. Somebody that has a lot of issues but yet she cares very much about. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B See, something I've done recently that I've really enjoyed. That I've really enjoyed. I enjoyed going over my brother's house and watching seeing him work on his Harley Davidson. He's building a Harley Davidson from the ground up. So I enjoyed going over there and seeing him get almost finished building this Harley from the ground up. That was something I really enjoyed doing. A Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? B I guess it would. A I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Okay, thank you. A Goodbye.

"A All right, I'm going to do something that sinks our equipment. Perfect. Now I'm going to go ahead and start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit and when she's done, she'll let you know. And I'm going to put the doorbell over here and you can let me know when you're done. B Okay? A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Pretty well. A That's good. Where are you from? B Originally from New York. A Really? Why did you move to la? B To go to college. Well, to San Diego to go to college and then later to la. Aerospace engineering. A How did you decide? B I was really good at math and science and I had an interest in airplanes. No, I'm a life coach. To be a life coach and help people. A Tell me more about that. B I really, really like how it feels to help other people and see them grow and know that I made a contribution to their life. A That's so good to hear. What are some things you really like about la? B I like the weather is great because I really like to do outdoor things and I like doing things by the ocean. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B Traffic and how crowded it is. A Do you have roommates? B Yeah, I like. I live with my girlfriend and so I like it. A How do you know them? B We met on eharmony. A How close are you to them? B Really close. A That's great. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B My meditation teacher. A Can you tell me about that? B Yeah. I used to be very shy and self conscious and have a lot of anxiety and I worry a lot about the future and I took classes, meditation and yoga classes and it really helped me to be more confident and more relaxed and just enjoy life a lot more. Meditate and do yoga. A What are some things that make you really mad? B Let's see. Really mad, I guess I don't know about mad. I don't get mad that often, but frustrated, I would say, like being stuck in traffic or people that do mean things to other people for no real reason. A What do you do when you're annoyed? B I usually talk to somebody about it if I can or if I can't, then I'll usually do meditation or yoga and try and just let it go. A That's good. How are you at controlling your temper? B Pretty good at controlling my temper. A When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? B With my girlfriend, and it was about she was driving on the freeway, and I suggested that she get over because there were some road workers on the side, and she refused to do that and stayed in the right lane. So we argued a bit about that. A How did you feel in that moment? B I felt like she wasn't listening to me and almost like she was purposely not doing what I suggested to be defiant. A Do you feel that way often? B Um, no. A That's good. What are some things you like to do for fun? B Rollerblade, kayak, sing. I sing in a choir. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B A trip I took to India and Nepal for six weeks. A Do you travel a lot? B Yeah, as much as I can. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B I really love to explore. I've loved to explore ever since I was a little kid, and so I love seeing new things and discovering things about new cultures, and I love backpacking in the wilderness and exploring nature. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B Cool. Well, I went on a trip to India and Nepal, my first time ever there. The first week and a half, I was with a big group of people and did a meditation and yoga retreat and went whitewater rafting on the Ganga River. And then I went off on my own for the rest of the trip and went backpacking in Nepal with a guide there. And it was just really beautiful in the Annapurna area. And then I went back into India and explored the area up near Tibet and then went to Rajasthan and to Tiger park in Madhya Pradesh and was, like, really close to tigers. A How did you decide to do that? B I was contacted by a friend of mine and told that they were going on this trip and I had always wanted to go to India, so I decided to do it. A That sounds like a great situation. B Yeah, it was really fun. A How would your best friend describe you? B Caring and enthusiastic for life. A That's good. Have you ever served in the military? B No. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Pretty easy. I don't sleep as well as I did when I was younger, but for the most part, I sleep well. Once in a while, I'll wake up, you know, at like four in the morning or five in the morning when I want to sleep till seven and not be able to get back to sleep. But in general, it's pretty good. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B I feel tired and not as motivated as usual and then sometimes want to take a nap in the afternoon. A Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior, thoughts lately? B No. A Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B 10 or 20 years ago, I guess too. I wish I would have invested money or bought like a house or something when I was younger. That would probably be the advice I would give myself. I am empathetic with other people, positive, and kind of have a positive outlook on life. Very determined. When I decide to do something, I'll figure out how to do it, even if it's challenging. I'm very creative in figuring out creative ways to do things. I guess probably the strongest thing is that I'm pretty balanced. I'm very organized, but I'm also pretty creative, so pretty balanced that way. A That's good. How close are you to your family? B Pretty close. Much closer than I was when I was younger. Although I'd say I'm probably closer to friends and people that are in a spiritual community with me than I'm able to get to my family. A Okay. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? B Being outdoors in nature and exercising and also singing. The fact that I've gone with, followed my heart and done what I wanted to do versus going with what I think I should do. A That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? B I guess yesterday I spent the day by the beach and just bicycled and went skating and visited some old friends there. A How did you feel in that moment? B Felt very relaxed and invigorated and also felt like I missed living by the beach because I used to live really close to the beach. So I guess a little bit sad that I didn't live there anymore, but really happy to be there. A I understand. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.

"A Thanks. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally unconventional. Are you okay with this? A Yes. B Okay. So how are you doing today? A Alright. B That's good. Where are you from originally? A I was born in Los Angeles, California. B Really? What are some things you really like about la? A Well, the weather and the fact that people aren't so obtrusive like on the East Coast. B What are some things you don't really like about la? A Just the traffic and the smoggy weather. B Do you travel a lot? A I used to. I'm unemployed now, so I rarely go anywhere. B Okay. What do you study at school? A I have a BS in business with a computer option. B How did you decide to do that? A I thought that the only place I could get a job with a business degree was in accounting or in business computer methods, so I took that. I took business computer methods option. B Okay. What's your dream job? A Oh, I'd probably be like a professional sports player or an actor. Something that you enjoy doing. B What are some things you like to do for fun? A I like to ride my bike. I like to watch sporting events. Now I can't afford to go to them, so I pretty much watch on tv. I like to travel, but like I said, I don't have money for that anymore. That's alright. B What are some things that make you really mad? A People who are chicken heads, they get their nose in other people's business, even if they're just strangers. You expect that from a family member or a friend, but you know, especially with the Internet, that feeds a lot of that. Now we know what Orwell was referring to when he spoke of big brother in 1984. B What do you do when you're annoyed? A I don't do much different than I would otherwise. B How are you at controlling your temper? A I've had many temper outbursts. B That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? A I argued with my aunt and it was because she was basically making leading statements, trying to trap me into saying something about a relative and it annoyed me greatly. B How close are you to your family? A I'm kind of on the outs with my parents. B Why? A Kind of the black sheep. B I understand. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? A Well, I mean, my mom's done the most to help me. She's done a lot, you know, more than anybody, by far. B Tell me more about that. A Well, I mean, she's just. I remember one time when I was in like 13, I went with a friend of mine to see the Crosley, Stills, Nash and Young concert at the Forum. And she has seven kids and she picked me up at the Sizzlers right across the street from the. At 11 o'clock at night. And I couldn't imagine with all she had to do that day that she agreed to do that, but she did. B What's one of your most memorable experiences? A Oh, probably going down to the Cape at the end of Baja Peninsula in Cabo San Lucas for photographing the Bridal Veil Falls in Yosemite. B How did you feel in that moment? A It was probably the two most majestic sights I've ever seen. B That sounds like a great situation. A It was when I could afford to travel. B Have you ever served in the military? A No. B Have you ever been diagnosed with pts? A No. B Have you been diagnosed with depression? A I was diagnosed with depression after a hospital visit in April of 2011, and I took some Lexapro. But I stopped after one day. I didn't want to do it anymore. B Do you still go to therapy now? A No. B Why did you stop? A Because I didn't feel it was helpful. I feel it was becoming a zombie. B That sucks. A Yeah. B How have you been feeling lately? A I'm depressed about not having a job for over two years. I lost my job in October 2010, and except for jobs like this, which I'm fortunate to get just daily things, focus groups like that, I haven't worked. B I'm sorry to hear that. A Thank you. B It can be tough to find a. A Good job these days, especially when you're 56 years old. B Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? A Well, just, I guess the general feeling of hopelessness. B How do you cope with them? A I get out on my bicycle a lot. I walk or bike four hours a day. About two hours each? Yeah. Very easy. Because now I'm old. When I was younger, I couldn't sleep more than four, six hours a night. B Why? A Because I'm restless. B Are they triggered by something? A No. But now that I'm old, I sleep much more easily. I pray before I go to sleep, and that's when I can't have any trouble sleeping. I just pray, recite different prayers, like the Lord's Prayer, Hail Mary, stuff like that. And I'm able to fall off the sleep. B When was the last Time you felt really happy? A I don't know. Probably. I can't have any specific remembrances of that. You know, it was when I had money to spend. I know that. And when I had to have a job to have money to spend. So it was probably 15 years ago. B Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. A Well, I haven't really enjoyed anything. Last week I made $75 on a job with the county. Basically, it was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel and they enlisted people to play, basically the relatives of people who had been in a fall bombing at the Staples Center. And we asked questions, signed up, told, gave them information on our missing relatives. And basically it was provided by the county and basically went through a routine in downtown la. B How hard is that? A Not hard. It was just a routine we had to follow. We had to act like we were actually missing somebody and had to give the specifics of their Characteristics. Height, weight, etc. B Wow. How would your best friend describe you? A I don't have a best friend. B What would you say are some of your best qualities? A I'm very bright. I'm a perfectionist at my job. I'd say that's about it. I got a business degree and I've never been a motivated person. I went to school, I went to two state colleges and two junior colleges to meet that end. So I believe that was probably the most significant contribution that I made to my, you know, to my, I guess, self esteem, you might say. So I had something to hang on the wall. B That's great. Is there anything you regret? A Yeah, I regret, you know, alienating family members. B What advice would you give yourself? A 10 or 20 years ago, I would have basically not been so impetuous and left jobs thinking that I could always get another one and not basically blow off jobs. I could probably work at one of the employers that I used to work for. Now they've added locations, but I burned bridges there, so that's not possible. B Okay.

"A it. Okay, so again, when she says goodbye, press this button. B ok. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I'm going to ask a few questions to start, and don't hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B I'm going pretty well. Where are you from? B I was born and I grew up here in Los Angeles. A really? What are the things you really like? B Time would be number one. I also like various cultures. I like the fact that there are a lot of different things here that you can do, and there are a lot of opportunities here, not only for me, but for my children. And I think it's really an ideal place when you try to establish a career, go to school, discover different people. What are the things you don't really like at it? B Traffic, the cost of living. Sometimes I think it's too big. And I think the transport system, with regard to the bus and trains, has been expected for a long time. They have to reorganize it or, you know, add more buses and things like that. Just allow people to move more easily on public transport. R I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B I travel when I can, a little here and there. I have not yet been abroad, which is one of my goals in the next couple. A few years. So I just travels at the national level. I try to make at least one trip a year somewhere. What do you like in travel? B I just like to get on the plane and go to places. Going especially somewhere, I have never been and learned about this place, you know, like. So, if I go to DC, I really look forward to it because it is a historic city, you know, things like that. My last trip would have been D.C. last year. I went to visit a friend and stayed, I think, three to four days, and I could see the Capitol. He showed me around, showed me all the landmarks and historic sites, the White House, the Capitol Building. I could see many other different government buildings, and it was. It was a good experience. The irony was that I had to fly on 9 11, and therefore it had a little uncomfortable. But once I was on the plane, in the air, I was fine. And everything was good. And once I was back home, I said to myself, yes, but I missed the trip and I can't wait to go back. A beautiful. What is my. B attend my friend's wedding. She had a wedding at destination in Hawaii, in fact MAUI. It was actually two, three, three years old. Three years ago in August. And I try to come back since and I want to take my children and I love it there and I can't wait to move it one day. A Tell Me on your children. B I have three sons, 13 years old, twins, boys. And my youngest is also a boy, he is 8 years old. They all have birthdays in June. The twins are June 9 and my baby is June 4. And so they are a few days apart, but five years apart technically. And they are just great, super typical boys, active everywhere, hormones, puberty. It is therefore an interesting period because you know, the two older boys cross puberty, their adolescence. My youngest still trying to understand certain things for himself, you know, making this transitional stage from 8 to 9 years old. He will therefore be 9 years old in June and my elder would be 14 years old, therefore. It is therefore a difficult period for me too. Just the joy of looking at what you put by being parent every day and to see how with love and development and law and you know, well, I cannot say an appropriate but just with, you know, love and nourish. How a baby becomes a toddler, in, you know, a young boy with a teenager then in a young man. And so this experience alone was enriching. I just look at my sons grow and go through these different stages and see how they have developed and you know, seeing some of the things they go through now that reminds my adolescence so much. And it's just, it's very rewarding and in fact, I can't wait to even be a parent family later in the line when they are older and at university because I really like children and restore. A it's so good to hear. What is the most difficult thing to be a parent? B There are probably a few things, but I would say that for me, being a single parent is the financier. Well, I would say that with some of the emotional, with them having to carry the weight of the responsibility of the breeding, of the child, you know, just the daily things of what you have to face. Sometimes when you are just tired, you don't want to be disturbed or try to do things by yourself. It must be remembered, okay, I have to cook or I have to choose My son or I have to take him to baseball training. This one wants to go here, it acts in a bad mood and, you know, just these, these types of challenges as well as the financiers and, you know, you assure, you know, you can put food on the table, you pay your rent and, you know, you follow day. And that's. These two are probably the most difficult things to manage. Well, I take it day by day. I just put one foot in front of the other. And I am extremely spiritual, so I just count on God and I pray a lot, meditate if I see that I need a little help, if, you know, I am not above asking for help. So, sometimes, if I have to reach out to people or see what other resources exist, to help me, you know, try to do it. And so for me right now, my biggest challenge is simply to try to go back to school to put myself in a better economic situation so that I can continue to support them comfortably. What did you study at school? B I studied communications, in fact. I was a major public relations for journalism with a minor in sociology. And now I study business. I just thought that, you know, there would be more opportunities for me with business with regard to jobs. And then I know, I want to go to higher education. So I thought in the long term that it was better. This would put me in a better position, would give me more opportunities with communications. It's a bit limited. And especially as you age, the fields of television reports and things as it has become, you know, more difficult to obtain. So I thought I would go in something more realistic and, you know, but I like the two fields. I really do it. I like to communicate, write, read, speak, as you can say, and we will see it. What is your dream work? B A couple, probably, but I would finally say that I travel, like working like a travel writer, go to different destinations, try different foods, write on different people, cultures, learn and live, you know, these different people and cultures, living between, you know, people there and be interactive with children and things like that. So I hope to be able to do this one day. But yes, it would be something in this direction. And then help would be an advisor, a social worker, something in this area. If I could include the three, I hope I could. I would like to do that. R consider yourself more shy or oug Oing? B This is actually a difficult question, probably because I initially grew up very shy. And I'm not so shy that I am booked now, but not conservative, but just reserved. And, you know, when I go somewhere, I check everything, everyone. And then once I get comfortable or accused myself of a situation, so I am like, okay, you know, I warm up until. To the situation or to the people. But I am also friendly. I can be very friendly and outgoing. I like to speak. You know, I seem to be a chatty coil, but I'm not really. So, generally, if I am in a large space with a lot of people, I don't like being the center of attention. I can get attached to one or two people and, you know, become friendly with them. But on the whole, I am an open and friendly person. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but. B This is the best I have. What are you doing to relax? B for me, it's. It could be something as simple as you disconnect everything, all electronics, and sit for a few moments, meditate, pray or read good spiritual writing, if I am able to do it. I like to go for a good massage, maybe get a facial, you know, things that will do it. I like the physical part a bit. Part of it. I like massages, things that really release tension, and if not, then, as I said, just seated at home by reading and praying or. I like the beach. I love the beach. So sometimes I drive and I will sit near the beach. I may also like to go to lunch by myself or give them a mani-pedi or maybe make lips, you know, things like that. A good. How are you going to control your temperament? B pretty well. Sometimes I'm just like. I don't really have a problem with the temperament than me. I'm coming. I am more impatient, unfortunately, many times with people and, you know, situations. So I can become really irritated or irritable, quite agitated. Especially if it is this period of the month for me, I just lose patience. Apart from that, I'm actually quite good. I try to be very, you know, aware of where I am and to be very patient with people, especially if I can see that the person looks like, if he is a new box at the counter or the cashier. I try to be. I try to be patient and understanding because I would like, you know, if it was me, I would like someone to prolong this, you know, with my children sometimes, you know, that's it, it also works in both directions. This is this period of the month, I M Like, leave me alone. Or I could have a short temperament or a short fuse. So I am aware of it. I try to be aware of it and try to monitor it. But you know, like everyone else, I am human in his time when I have my days or moments when I could love Ah, leave and lose. Well, I didn't really have it, not in itself an argument, but there was something in progress with American Express. So I would say because it was not personal contact but a business, I was really an argument, but you know, I had problems with American Express. I had to call on I think on Saturday and I kept, I did not get the answer I expected. And so all the contact, the call was just back and forth, very frustrating and I was upset and you know, the representative tried to speak to me, then I was trying to speak to him. So, you know, I do not know if you would consider it an argument, but I would certainly say that it is the last time you know, I just like having reached my bowling point to say the least and was really upset and it was the closest, you know, an argument and I had to recall this morning. This one did not really degenerate to an argument, but it was a tense exchange for a minute or two. A I see. Tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B probably the most recent contact and it would have been on Saturday with American Express or it was actually on Sunday. Yeah. And I know that the person was trying to help me, but you know, when you are constantly telling you different things and I had to call about five or six times on the same situation and it is not resolved. It takes you there. So, I continued to raise my voice, I said certain things that I should not have and I allowed myself to lose control of the contact. I really like to feel in contact with contact and so it took me there. My blood pressure was raised, excuse me. And I was just a kind of mess for a while for a while for 30 minutes or an hour later, just irritable and agitated and upset. And so I always try to, you know, to go back and to remove them and to know, to do my own sense of feedback and to see how I could, you know, manage things differently. But it is the one I would have really liked to be able to keep my cool and be more directed by the level and, and I have not really raised my voice and, you know, been more polite. A good, tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. B well, I probably had a couple, but pro Bly the most is a situation years ago when I just had my sons and probably my twins, they were probably about 2 years, and I was again in a situation with their father and I was pregnant and it was simply not a good time. And he, you know, was not comfortable with me to have another child at the time. And I was not comfortable having another child either, but I wanted to keep the baby. But he put me so much stress and, you know, in a way, I mean, really pushed me to have. Finish it. Pregnancy. And it has always been with me and I have always missed this pregnancy, this child. I think about it, this baby or what could have been. I try not to have anger or resentment towards him or anyone on this subject, but I secretly know secretly, if I had to start again, I would have it. I would have kept the baby and move forward. It would therefore probably have been the most difficult, especially emotionally. I could take care of myself a lot and I had treated a lot with a lot, you know, being unemployed or, you know, a lot of financial problems, but for me, it was the most difficult. THANKS. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no no. How have you been feeling lately? B ok. You know, I was dismissed in December, so I constantly tried to do things, you know, get back on my feet. So it was a bit difficult. I had. I had to face a lot of challenges and face this and problems with children's alimony and try to find another job and go back to school. So I have. My range of emotions is right. Were just this arrangement. And a very good friend of me now that we both started, you know, in the same place about five years ago, well, she was able to go ahead and continue her life and now she graduated next month from the USC with her master in social work. So I feel a little envious of that. And I was like the last year, but more recently, even if I am very, very happy for her, you know, and she is a good person and she deserves it. But yes, of course, at the bottom of the interior, I want it to be me. So it also bothered me. R I understand. B well, I'm really good with people. I communicate well. I like to speak very well with children. This is why I would like to teach or be advisable. Although I didn't really use it, I know I am a very creative person. I know I write pretty well. I could be a creative writer, but I know that I am very creative. So if giving In the opportunity, I know that I could draw on it and really develop these skills. Something like with perhaps writing songs, fictional writing, probably like interior decoration. Everything that is artistic, everything. Because I like music, I like the arts, I like drama, I like the pieces. I'm not a big fashion enthusiast, but I like fashion and makeup and things like that. So I think it would be my strengths as well as to agree with people that I know that I would make a big adviser. People, people. My friends come to see me all the time. I have a good ear for listening. I am a great mediator and I know how to do it. Because I experienced a lot and one of my friends called me the voice of reason, the one who is actually graduated from SC. But I know that I am like light years in front of many people with regard to insight and wisdom. And I don't know if it has to do with it, you know, having older parents myself or how I grew up or at. I had very traditional southern parents who instilled me a lot of great values ​​or if it has something to do with my astrological sign. I am fish. But me. I'm really good with people just, you know, period. You know, as I said, I have my moments. But I know if. If it is something in which I could go and develop, I would do well. Is there something you regret? B not really. Some of the situations I would have liked to wait maybe I got married before I had children, I chose another partner. And I say that. I mean, my son's father is great, but a grandfather for my children, but not as much a partner for me. We are not together. We have not been together for years. But I just say overall, I think I had me. My dreams and goals and doing things like I was predicting in a way at the start, and I think it is. It would be honestly. The only thing I could say that I regret is not to follow my goals and finish school in time and to pursue what I really wanted to do. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Stay concentrated and finish the school and choose a career path and stay on it and stay motivated. And don't let anything and no one dissuades you. I think I am quite stable and consistent with the whole, I think, how I face adversity, how I face things. You know, I am a fairly committed person. I try, you know, if I say that I will do something, I try to stick to it. I am a very faithful friend, and I am proud of th Make I have. I maintained and did a very good job by raising my children for so long. A good. I think I asked for everything I need. B agree, great. THANKS. A bye. B bye.

"A now, oops. B could have drawn something. R So I'm going to bring the doorbell here. When she tells you goodbye and says you're done, press this button. B large. Thank. Thank you so much. THANKS. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B oh, I'm fine. I'm a little tired, but I discovered that my thyroid was, I think, acting. SO. Where are you from? B I was born in Canada, but I lived in California almost all my life, therefore. And it's gray today too, so gray weather makes you somehow, you know, slow. When did you move to the? B oh, my God, years and years ago. How often do you go back to your hometown? B not at all. I don't think I have been going back there for a long time. Well, air rates have increased a lot in recent years. Gas prices have increased. So travel. As much as it is a fun thing to do, it is a prohibitive cost. SO. How does he compare himself to the? B oh, let's see. Everything has more and drawbacks. Cold weather, not as much sun, so I think I would prefer to have more sun and have hot weather. But other than that, it's very pretty there. Natural landscape. But I love it here. You know, traffic is heavy, but it's a little thing to manage. R I see what you mean. Why did you move to the? B Why did I move to it? Because my family came here and started. My father obtained a job here and it became our attachment base, and that is why. As you have been easy for you. A habit of living in Los Angeles? B easy, very easy. So it's good. What did you study at school? B Well, in high school, you generally study General Ed. They have appointed lessons. And then, after that, I went to the university and I was a corporate adult. Let's see, I was a major veterinary and I graduated in liberal arts. So what made you decide to do this? B I don't know. I can't really determine why. A good. Do you still work in there? B I worked in social services, but I also worked in sales and, more recently, I do real estate. I am a part -time rental consultant. Are you happy that you did that? B I mean, everything has more and drawbacks. It's good. I don't really see too many negatives. What is your dream work? B OH, probably to work as a gossip columnist at TMZ or one of these networks. But as you know, everything in the entertainment sector is very competitive. Who you know, therefore. But that would be my dream work. Or working with cats, you know, animals. SO. Do you consider yourself more shy or out? B I'm very out of the way. In fact, I think I'm so out of the way, I was afraid of people sometimes. There are a lot of calm and reserved people there, so I'm a bit of the east coast, very. You know, I get to people and tell them. Very social. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B oh, my god. There is. I could do hundreds of things. I could read. I could watch a show, light the music. The music is great. Place a walk, call my friends. Million things. So how do you wait, control your temperament? I'm pretty good. I am very good. I mean, you know, of course, when you lead to Los Angeles and someone cuts in front of you, sometimes it can be irritating. But I am. I'm really pretty. I am not the kind of person who will fight or get. I don't like to have confrontations, so that's good. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone? B I don't really remember. So Leslie said there were not many arguments. Usually I avoid arguments at all costs. A good. What do you feel guilty? B I really don't feel guilty of anything right now or that I can think of. To tell me about a situation you want you to manage differently. B I can't think about anything for the moment. A hmm. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to make. B I really can't think of decisions that were really difficult. I mean, most of them. It's easy for me to make a decision, so I have no family, so if I have to. You know, I had to move to San Francisco for a job once, but as I am single, I don't really have to consider others and children and this kind of thing. So it makes certain things easier when you have no other families to consider. Who makes sense. B yeah. A Tell Me on an event or something you want to be able to erase. B of your memory, an event. Hmm. Well, of course, you don't know, the death of a family member, you know, you want everyone to be there forever. So I know when my father is dead, you know, I mean, I would have liked to have it much longer. I mean, he died at the age of 77 and You know, it would have been good to have it a little more, but, you know, I cannot control these things. Life has its own way of managing this. A There are always compromises in life, right? B Yes, there is yin and yang. It is an old philosophy and it really applies. There are advantages and disadvantages and negatives and positive points. A Tell Me on your relationship with your family. B well, as I said, my father is no longer there and my mother and I, you know, we have our differences. I think mothers and girls are still doing it. My brother and I hear very well. I see it a lot. My sister works a lot. I see her and we speak and she has in a way her own life and her children, I get along very well with them. A it's good. B We have a small family. Again, it is as if it was a difficult question to answer. There are so many types of children. I think the majority of them seem to behave quite well. I mean, there will always be children who are a little out of control, but I don't know, those I have seen recently, they behave very well. So I can't say much else about it. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B well, I live in an apartment and I do not know if you have already lived in an apartment, but there is someone who lives above me. I am on the first floor and there is someone on the second floor and they are quite calm, but they are used to, I suppose they have a lot of energy. They will usually take their showers around midnight and sometimes they will start washing the laundry at midnight. And of course, the pipes run through the bedroom wall, it seems that Niagara falls into it. And so I don't do it. Yeah, and I need eight hours of sleep and I only manage, oh, I might say six hours. And then I generally wake up once in the evening too, because sometimes they will do so. Around 2 or 3 am, they walk or I will hear something. So I don't sleep eight hours. And it is definitely. But there are not, as I said, there are things you cannot control when you live in an apartment. You know, I mean, the lady is very calm. It's just that she is used to, you know, to take showers later, to wash the clothes at night. It is. I can't tell him about it. Yes, but, you know, there are people who are in worse situations, so I don't do much, you know, and I'm just. It's not like every night, but it's, you know, at least twice a week. So me, you know, I may have considered sleeping G in another room, but for now, you know, it's. I will face it. So what do you like when you sleep? B Well, tired. Very tired. And difficult to concentrate, difficult to concentrate. It takes me more time to get things done because I don't have my energy. In addition, I did not exercise. I normally try to walk for about half an hour a day, but the time has been a little colder and dirtier, so you know, I am not so motivated when time is a blah. It is therefore a combination of not exercising and not sleeping eight hours. How have you been feeling lately? B as I said before, tired. It is a combination of the weather. You know, here in Los Angeles at the moment, we have spent very gray days. I live very close to the ocean, so the sun does not come out much, so I do not receive my serotonin. I need it. I don't sleep my eight hours because it doesn't matter. And I think my thyroid also acts, so it's a kind of creation. I have vitamin deficiencies, and once the sun is starting, I am a little more energetic. It just gives you more energy. A good. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B I am happy most of the time. I am a fairly happy person. And I like to be with other people. I mean, of course, I like my private time, but I like to be a little with people. So tell me about something you have done. A recently that you really enjoyed. B HMM. I can't think about anything for the moment. I mean, I generally appreciate everything I do. There is nothing that stands out more than anything else. A good. Is there anything you regret? B No, I never regret anything. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B What advice would I have given? Well, I guess, yes, I could probably change things. I think that. Everyone could. I would probably have had another adult in college, you know, it seems that it is. What else? I would probably not have dated with some men, lost with some people. I don't know. These are the things that come to my mind. Maybe I started saving money earlier, you know, these types of things. A but how would your best friend describe you? B OUTTING, Lots of fun with it. Just a good friend to have. People like to have me for a friend. I am faithful, confident and listening. I am a good listener. I'm also very patient, so it's good. What are some things you want you to change about you ? B well, number one would be to lose weight, but I think it's a global problem. I mean, there is a lot of food around and temptations, and especially here in America, many of us are sofa potatoes. We sit down before our computers. We. You know, it's just easy to do. It's so easy to relax, you know, it's hard to get up and move. You have to talk to it. The weight therefore gives you more energy too, if you lose weight. So it's a great thing too. But that's probably the thing. Just the weight. A yeah, I understand. How would your best friend describe you? B I think you may have asked me this question before, but if you wish, I will repeat it. Do you know that you are some of your best qualities? B I am very. As I said, I am very faithful. When I tell people I am going to do something, I do it. Very reliable. I'm hot. I am very friendly. I am a large listener. And I heard so many people tell me that they like to be with me. So, as I said, I am quite optimistic. You know, I don't let things go too much. SO. What are you most proud of in your life? B HMM. This is a difficult question. I can't think. I mean, I am. I can't think of responding to that one. SO. What things do you like to do to have fun? B for fun? Well, I like movies. I could see all the films they made. I love going out with my friends, shopping, exchanging meetings. My God, traveling is great. Road trips. It is sort of, you know, a part I mentioned. What do you like in travel? B travel, be able to see different places. The historical aspect of this one, foods, appreciating food in different countries, architecture. It's just a little careful to escape and see a completely different place. To I would love to hear about one of your trips. B ok. Well, I have gone to many places in Europe. I love Paris. It is such an educational city. You can. The one who designed this city, I will tell you. I mean, you can go from one point to another. The metros are great. Each area has its own distinctive type. There is the Latin district where the students are. There is another area where, let's say that fashion designers are a bit like our driving in Rodeo here in Beverly Hills, there is a more African neighborhood and they have weekend meetings that are wonderful. It's very international. And then, as I said, once you got out of Paris, there is so many history. You can go see Versailles. There are other palaces. You can go south of France, but it's probably my favorite country to try. I also went to Italy. R that looks like an excellent situation. B yeah. Well, after university, people generally. I mean, people who go to university or before or after university, this is the ideal time to go to Europe because you are young and you are not linked. You have no family and you have a more adventurous spirit. You have more energy. So wearing a backpack or suitcases is not a big problem. SO. Yeah, it's true. One yeah. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. B Thank you. Bye. A good. B oh, that. It was fast. I didn't do it. There was not. There was not, like shocking questions. He. Are you waiting for the worst? B yeah. To Never Know, I suppose. Exactly.

"So now I'm going to bring Mr. Robert here and when she has finished, she will let you know and you can press this button. B ok? A thank you. B nothing. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started and do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. A it's good. Where do you come from? B Michigan. A really? When did you move to the? B two years ago. How often do you go back to your hometown? B every three months. How does he compare himself to the? B is more intimate and country than the rapid rhythm and all that. Why did you move to the? B I work in the entertainment sector, so I had to be here. How is you easy to get used to living in Los Angeles? B It was quite easy because I lived in New York first and if you can survive New York, you could survive Los Angeles. R I see what you mean. What are the things you really like? B The weather, of course. Beaches. People are much coarse and bad than what I am used to. But I like it. What did you study at school? B graphic design. Media arts. Who seems interesting. How did you decided to do this? B In high school, I was ahead in all my lessons and my credits, so I had to take a university course. So, in high school, I obtained a two -year university degree. Do it because I was good in this area. Yeah, but now I want to go in something else. I am in school in fact. I take online lessons now for business management. What is your dream work? B I'm really. One day I want to own. My sisters and I want to have our own rental properties and as a real estate company. We now have six houses. We bought with our collegial money and now one day we want to have our own houses and complexes of apartments. A it's great. I am sure you can say by my shoes that I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B yeah. What do you like in travel? B Meet new people. See different things that you have never seen before. Different languages, everything. Just see what the world has to offer. To I would love to hear about one of your trips. B oh, okay. My sisters and I went to Hawaii last year and I think we went to Honolulu and then to Hawaii. Yeah. And we met people in Hawaii and they were so nice. I F I could live there, I would. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B Everything was memorable, but probably the Jet Ski in Honolulu was very fun. A great. B yeah. Do you consider yourself more shy or out? B outgoing. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B Music. Music is a lot of therapy for me. Can you tell me? B well, my family is very musical, like my father and my mother's family. Music has therefore always been like this thing. No matter what I feel, if I put music, it makes it much better. A it's so good to hear. How are you going to control your temperament? B I'm pretty good. I used to box, so it let out a lot of frustration. So sometimes I do this too. I go to the gymnasium and I do, like a kickboxing course, but I don't. I am never degenerated to the point where I am extinguishing or. No, I can control it roughly. A good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B well, I live with my sister, so I chat every day, but it was on clothes. My sister and my clothes are always close. A Tell Me on your relationship with your family. B my mother and my father are pastors of a church. I grew up with two sisters and an older brother who was a cop. And we are quite close. I have a nephew. We are quite close. Like every day, we see each other. And we don't all live in the same house, but we are together every day at some point when we lived in Michigan. My family is in Michigan. A big one. What do you feel guilty? B When I cheat. Like, at the moment, I'm with a diet with my sisters, but last night, I faufilé and I had McDonald's, so I feel bad because they stayed so much. And I cheated, but that's about everything. To tell me about a situation you want you to manage differently. Hobo. Hmm. Me and my. When me and my. One of my friends entered it and we said things that were not, as we hit under the belt we. And we generally do not do it. And we haven't talked, like three months now. And I know that it could have been prevented if we had sat down and we were talking about, but that did not do so far. SO. Yeah. To Tell Me on the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. B UM, probably moving here, moving to the because, as, I am really, like. We are really close to our family. Like, I skype with my mother and father every day, so it was difficult to go There here and they take care of everything. For me and my sisters having to do it by ourselves, it was a lot. It was different. One yeah. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B oh, my kindness. My parents, my brother, my father, my mother, my sisters, my family. I have a big family, so my family, certainly. A good, tell me about an event or something you want to be able to erase from your memory. B I mean, two years ago, three years ago, my brother was shot in service and he almost lost his life. But he didn't do it. And for any reason, as much as I try, I don't tell them that because I don't want them to be like, I need, you know, no matter. But I always think about it again and again, and I will cry as if it happened yesterday, but it happened three years ago. Just the simple fact of losing it almost. Somehow. Yeah. Who seems really difficult. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B Not easy. I work as a personal assistant and administrative assistant for a casting agent, so I am on the call every time, so I am never. I never have a good night's sleep. Who sucks. B I know. How are you when you don't sleep well? B I am a zombie. I'm about. You would never know it, because when it works, I am professional, so if I am tired, they never know. But I am very bored and very grumpy when I sleep. A good. How do you feel recently? B tired. And I have crazy headaches, but it's probably not to sleep enough and work too much. But, yes, very tired. Have you noticed changes in your behavior or your thoughts or. B yeah, definitely. One like what? B I'm shorter with people. Like, being in industry. I mean, people don't really care. Everything is about self. And when I came here, I had the personality and attitude of the family and love and kind. And being here showed me that everyone is sort of for me here, even if, like the other girls I work with. So I learned to cut people and to be short with people when it's not really me. But I just see it's like that. One yeah. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B last Saturday. I made a weighing and I lost seven pounds. I was, like, excited. So it was the last time. A it's great. How would your best friend describe you? B cares too much?

A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing okay. It's still morning. So where are you from originally? I'm from the East Coast. Massachusetts. A Really? B Yes. A When did you move to la? B I moved to LA when I was a child with my parents. Pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B I haven't been back there. The last time I was back there was three years ago for Christmas. A How does it compare to la? B LA is very hustle and bustle. There's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person. Here in la, in which. Back East. The east coast, the thought pattern is a lot different. You know your neighbors, you're friendly to your neighbors and to anybody that you see in the street. So. Yeah. A How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B Well, since I was a kid. I was fairly young at first it was rough. I was getting in trouble a little bit in school, but after all that surpassed. I did fine in high school and stuff and even took some college courses. A That's good. What are some things you really like about la? B Well, I love the beach and I love the mountains. I like to go hiking and I like walking along the beach. I just live a few blocks away from the beach, so it's easy. A Nice. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B No, not at all. A Why? B Just not interested. I've been to Mexico a couple of times when I was younger, went to Ensenada, but other than that, I'm not interested in leaving the United States, especially with what's been going on Lately, overseas. A Okay. What'd you study at school? B Actually, child psychology. And I was in the nursing program for a little bit, but I had some problems at home which caused me to drop out. A I'm sorry to hear that. B Oh, that's right. A I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? B I don't have one. To be honest, I admire people that are doing the job that they love. I mean, like football players. They love playing football and they get paid all that money. How great is that? A So do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I'm pretty outgoing. When I meet somebody, at first I might be a little bit reserved because we all, when we meet somebody, pass judgment as to if we want to continue communicating with the person or not. But once I've decided that I like that person or whatever, I talk a lot. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. B Yes. A What do you do to relax? B I like watching movies. I used to like reading, but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great, so it's hard to get into a good book. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Not good. At times I have some outburst every once in a while. It depends on how angry I get. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Yesterday. And it was with my partner. And actually, to be honest, I don't remember what it was about. It's just sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and I don't appreciate that. And if I feel that I'm being disrespected or whichever, I'm going to stand up for myself. A Has that gotten you in trouble? B At times some people may be turned off from my personality because. Very opinionated and I say what's on my mind. I. I do not purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature. But I won't be bullied and I won't be made. I won't back down if I feel like I'm being challenged. So. A Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Last year my mother died, so I wish I handled that differently. A Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? B It upsets me, so I'm sorry. It's okay. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Let me see. I think I'm going to pass on that one, too, because that will upset me. More. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B That is terrible. Sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem, especially when you're done working and doing everything that you have to do in a day. You're tired. But. But staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like I can't. I get up and then I'm wide awake. I'll go out in the living room, turn on the TV and watch tv. I'm lucky if I get three to four hours sleep. A Are they triggered by something? B Maybe, because I do have a lot of my mind, you know, thinking about bills and the stressfulness of work and. And all this other stuff. So that's probably a big part of it. A That sounds really hard. B It's not difficult. It's just frustrating because when your mind goes on overtime mode, it. It just affects everything. Your concentration, your sleep, your eating, everything. So. A What do you like when you don't sleep well? B A little grouchy, especially in the morning. I'm not a morning person. I like the nights, but I don't like the morning. It's like, leave me alone till I get my first cup of coffee. So other than that, I'm okay. Well, I've been depressed for quite some time and I'm still having difficulty. Difficulty because after my mother died, four months later, my uncle died. So I had two deaths last year. So I'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together. Just recently I've started pursuing interests that I used to do that I haven't done in a year because of what happened. A That's good. That's good. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B Just. I might get angry a little easier. I sleep a lot. I eat, I overeat. I get tired very easily because I'm not getting much sleep. So sometimes it's hard. It seems like I'm struggling to get through the day. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yes. I have a psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis. Oh. I was diagnosed quite some time ago, probably 10 to 15 years ago. And it's just something I've never gotten over. I don't know whether or not you can. So I've always taken the medicine. A What got you to seek help? B I was arguing with everybody, my family, my friends and stuff like that. And I was feeling desperate and hopeless. And I had attempted to take my own life years ago, which caused me to be hospitalized. And then they started treating me. I started seeing a therapist. A Is going To a therapist helping you. B Well, right now I'm not going to a therapist because my insurance, they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist. But I am working with a friend of mine who knows some avenues to go to seek help for a therapist. And I don't know if that's really going to help me. I. I mean, sometimes it depends on what kind of therapist you get. Sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and ramble on, and you're thinking, my God, what good is this? And the other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback as to how to deal with the emotions. Tools to help you deal with your emotions. A Changes. Have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? B Like I said, I haven't been going to therapy recently, just psychiatrists, just medication. There's been no changes, really. I probably would be doing fine because I was doing great before my mom passed away. I was her caregiver. And even though a lot of times I felt overwhelmed or lacked patience with her, I still was a heck of a lot happier than I am now. So. A Okay. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B I would say when my son was born years ago. A Do you find it easy to be a parent? B I'm not a parent anymore. He passed away, and that was difficult as well. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm extremely organized, extremely reliable. My work loves me because I get everything done that I'm supposed to get done, Even though sometimes I feel a little scatterbrained. And, you know, those qualities are admirable in people that can keep their word and be responsible. A That's great. Is there anything you regret? B Excuse me? A Is there anything you regret? B Oh, I have lots of regrets. Things that I've done in the past that I'm not too happy about. But, you know, I met somebody once in my life that had that saying, and you see it on a bumper sticker, live to never regret. So, you know, you can't go back and make changes. It's too late. So why, you know, dwell on the situation? But sometimes it's a lot easier said than done, right? A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B I'm not the advice kind of get person, you know, I don't really give my friends any kind of advice. I mean, I find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway, so why bother? I just state my opinion, that's all. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Well, right now I'm on a diet because of my overeating after my mom died. I was a lot thinner when she was alive. I just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot, you know, sleep, eat, sleep, eat. And so now I'm kind of like on a diet trying to lose this weight because it's very unhealthy for me. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Trying to think. It's been a long time. Actually, there's really nothing because now I just keep my mind busy. I haven't been to a movie in ages. I don't. I used to go out shopping all the time. I don't now. So it's been. It's been quite some time since I've been content and happy with who I am and what I'm doing in my life right now. A Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B My weekends, like on Saturday, I'm usually working. On Sunday is usually clean up day. You know, do your laundry, clean up the house, run some errands, go shopping for food, you know, that kind of thing. So it's not. If I was younger, you know, it would be fun, you know, go out clubbing or whatever. But I'm too old for that now. A Proud of in your life. B Really? There's nothing that I can think of. There's nothing that I can be proud of. A What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? B A good. Like comedy or whatever. I like to watch that Sometimes my partner might do something stupid, which I like because I like make fun of them. But that's it, you know, maybe go out for a walk on the beach. That's it. A Everything I need to. B Okay. A Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B No problem. Thank you. A Goodbye. B Bye. Does somebody talk for her or. She's just talking to me, really. A It's her voice. I. I'll actually explain to you how she works. Once we're finished up with the study. B We can talk more about it.

"How we know it works. Okay, so if you move your arms a little. B should I move my arms? An OH, so it shows that it is active. We know it works. Okay, so now I'm going to do something. It seems really silly, but we will take our equipment and now I will start the virtual. She will ask you questions and chat with you. And when you are done, she will let me know that you are finished. B and if it is not the case, say, do not answer this. If I said, I don't answer that. Remember that that's it. Okay, that's all. Do I have to press a button to start or start alone? All right. Impressive. A people in a safe and secure environment. I am not a therapist, but I am here to find out more about people and I like to teach us about you. I will ask a few questions to get started and do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B well. And you? A I am great, thank you. Where are you from? Initially? B here. A really? B yes. What are the things you really like at? B Time? Time? Above all, yes, time. Sorry, not people, but some people. Tips like that. Some people, yes. Okay, I cut you. Not as much as before. I was at school and I used to travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that. But I'm not at school right now. Later, I will come back to school, I will travel more, but right now, I have softened myself. What do you like in travel? B I don't do it. I don't like to travel. What are you studying at school? B This is a good question. You are actually pretty well. I studied physics and aerospace engineering. But mainly physics. Yes, I am actually. At the moment, I teach the physics of the community college and astronomy. But I always do research in physics too because I like this type of thing. And I go back to higher education. I hope that is why I am sometimes nervous on the questionnaire. Impressive teacher. In a place like USC or UC or something or something like that where teachers do three hours of work per week and graduate students do the rest. You are actually quite good in this area. There are a lot of people. The first, I guess he is my physics teacher. A teacher of physics AP at high school. Even if he led me to become an engineer instead of an adult in physics, he always had a very good influence that he told me, you know, he is the first who taught me that the school did not concern a note but on Lea Ring. All right. I'm pretty good. I think I'm single, so I don't get many arguments. But he's probably my brother about doing him stupid things too. Play a video game together. I know I'm old enough to play video games, but they are actually quite good. It's probably something like that and being angry with him and trying to offend himself and me. All this is quite close. I see them quite often. Parents. I see them a few times a week. They age, so I help them with grocery store and things like that. And my brother, I see the same thing with them, at the same time. My sister, I put to her children, my nephews, so I see them once a week as interesting. Yes. Because I spent long periods of mathematics and reading and not talking to anyone. It's introverted. I guess I play video games or. And I train. I train. I think a lot. I try at least. What are you doing when you are boring? B I roll my eyes. What told me is a bad thing. And that's about it. I think. Essentially poor parenting. Parents are more self-central, more in themselves, unlike previous generations. And children do just what they want because parents are not there. Parents are not parents. My personal opinion. Who makes sense. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B I guess. THANKS. A best friend described. B I don't really have a best friend. Intriver, remember that I am a supporter of course, but they are. I am really gifted in mathematics. I don't really know if you can't. Not to say that you cannot improve that me in mathematics. But the fact is that it is just that you reach a certain confidence in it where no matter what you have to learn in mathematics, you can always understand it. I am patient, I think and I am disciplined. Where I can spend several hours, a lot, many, many hours reading books that might not be important, but they could be important, so I have to do it anyway. This type of thing. What are the things that usually. B When I'm well trained in video games. Small things like that. When something happens with my. My type of research, something type of mathematical physics. When it goes well, most puts it. It puts me in a good mood. THANKS. Right now, this is the fact that the research I did, I did so far in terms of research. That's it. It's all interesting. When you start at school, you read on Einstein and things like that. He says general relativity and you hear about particle physics and you have no idea what it is. You know , these are very complicated things such as quantum mechanics. And you start to realize that you are interested, but you don't know if you can really do it. And finally, each step, as long as time passes, over time, you get closer and closer. Finally, you are the goal. Finally, you realize that you are not as good as Einstein. But you are up there. You can do physics research, you can add advanced knowledge and science. And it's impressive that you didn't see yourself doing this when you are a child. All right. A few weeks ago, when I got a good note in a class. THANKS. Yes, briefly. Several years ago. Yes. I don't know. Growing up, I always thought it was. I always thought it was my dream when I was a child. That's why. And I just did that. I was the national guard, I think that about 18, 19. I was ordered at 2021. I was only for about a year, so I left at 22. Yes. Not really. How is it. Certainly change you. B I don't think it did. I think that's just something you grew up. Something that I grew up while waiting for myself to be something really changed me. Graduate School and Physics. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B It depends if I work very hard the day before. If I work hard enough, it's bad. But if I don't train, I don't know. It's difficult, I suppose moderately. THANKS. Yes, that's fine. Probably as I am now. Normal, I think. Not as. Not as happy for everything, but always good enough. I can always work. No. Maybe slightly. Sorry. No. Yes. Yes, I have changes my thoughts. Apply again at the higher school. It's been a while. And slightly worried. Glad it looks good, but apprehensive that it is not good. Things like that. How difficult? B what do you mean by that? I know it's your computer, but. As how difficult is it to manage these thoughts or to know how difficult is it to go to higher education? To understand. Okay, I agree. No, not really. Probably continue to do what you do. Even if I'm not so old. Believe it or not, 20 years ago, I was probably 15 years old. No, no, I was 15 years old. Continue to do what you do. I think I was very lucky and lucky about how it worked if it was a little different. I don't think it worked so well. Even if it's not perfect now, I think I'm going very well personally. THANKS. Same here. Bye. I will continue that. Remove this now.

Yes, yes, I'm quite happy with what I do. I do advice, so I write marketing plans, this kind of thing. How difficult? B It can be quite difficult. Can you tell me? B About the writing of a marketing plan? I don't know. It is difficult to tell someone who is not in marketing. It just requires knowledge of how it is done and it takes several months to make one. Do you consider yourself more shy or mean? Hobo. Well, I guess I am. I am originally shy, but I become more out just because of work and things. A it's good. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I like to exercise. I hike with my dogs. We go up and descend a hill several times. GOOD. I don't remember. I don't know. Nothing comes to mind. Sometimes I don't clean my car. I receive a lot of dog hair and I feel bad when I should always stay at the top. Actuate just in-car and stuff. Well, I had a conflict with my brother, so I had to decide to have an Eastr The whole of him, and it makes the most sense. And it was a somewhat difficult decision. But just because of his angry behavior. This was not the case. It was not so difficult. But, you know, it was a little difficult because I liked it very much. SO. A Tell Me on your relationship with your family. B I'm not close to my family, so I don't really have them. I have a Japanese friend. Uh. Oh, I think the sensor has come off. I have a Japanese friend with whom I am very close. She is like my. A bit of my mother, and I met them socially. I don't know. Nothing comes to mind. Yeah, I think the sensor has come off. All right. Just a kind of A. A good. B ok. Sorry about it. B oh, of course. All right. All right. Sorry. B ok. A good. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B fairly easy, because I keep a regular schedule. I'm just a little tired, maybe a little irritable. How have you been feeling lately? B well. Have you noticed changes in your behavior? B well, I recover from the SSPT, so I sometimes feel the SSPT, then I take a medication for that. Did you deal with something? B No, it's just leftovers. I always have stress. I am always treated for that. I don't really have them. I prefer not to talk about it in the past, but it is treated. Five years ago, I was very sad, very depressed, and therefore I still had anxiety. So I went to see a doctor, and they helped me, and I did psychotherapy. Are you going to always in therapy now? B yeah. For the SSPT, however? I don't know. I assume that just a little support because of the problems I have with my family. It is favorable to a doctor who supports and, you know, it just gives me good comments and helps me make good decisions, this kind of thing. Do you have any disturbing thoughts? B Yeah, I sometimes have nightmares on my family. Yeah. THANKS. I'm just trying to sleep better before falling asleep. I meditate a bit to be calm, then I hope it will help you. A really happy. B I feel happy all the time. A bit like my dogs make me happy and, you know, my life is really happy, so it's great. MM. How are your best friends? Here. B I guess you know, as a kind person, I am thought out, a good friend and a happy and fun person. What are the things in which you could change about you? B I don't know. I mean, I'm in her forties now, so I'm quite happy with myself. You know, my, you know, I did a lot of things. Lots of work on myself in therapy and all that. So I'm pretty . I wouldn't really change much. I'm quite happy with myself. I mean, so as not to look in vain, but I'm happy enough from me now. It would be my parents. They are very abusive, so I don't talk to them anymore. So, at any time with them, they did me terrible things. I'd rather not talk about it. To Tell Me on something you recently did that you really enjoyed. B see. Well, I just started reading a book. I like to read cooking books and I just read a book called When French Women Cook. And this is the relationship of a woman with different women in France, in different parts of France and cooking. And so I really appreciate this book. Usually I know, I make the grocery store, what I like. I really like to make the grocery store. I go in a few places, then I do a little cleaning and I relax. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B oh, yes, I would say to have better self -esteem because I used to have a very low self -esteem, you know, to be mistreated. And so, you know, I would have liked to be happier in the past and you know, it took me a long time to become happy because, you know, no matter what I did, whatever the achievements, I was never happy in the past. I always had trouble being depressed. I didn't even know why. And now I realize because of the events he came from my parents, from this relationship. And so the advice would be not to have a relationship that is bad for you. Like sometimes, distance is the best choice in an abusive relationship. Just the way I live my life, the way I treat people, I think, you know, I think your actions are very important and I try to treat people in the right direction. And I guess I am proud of my work decisions that I have taken which give me a job that I like, which gives me a lot of flexibility and I do what I like. And people love my work and also my dogs. I'm really proud of them. Yeah, I had. I don't know. Okay, thank you. Bye. It was funny. Yeah.

B I meditate. How are you going to control your temperament? When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B I argued with my mother. She left my college certificates outside and they were crumpled and damaged and that has somehow upset me. To tell me about a situation you want you to manage differently. B Everything happens for a reason, so I don't know if I manage something differently. A good. What do you feel guilty? B my failures. To Tell Me on the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. B I don't know because I am usually, at that time, to my heart, whether I like it or not. Move from the first instinct.

A why do you decide to enlist in the army? B wanted to move away from the house. Are you happy that you did that? B yes. A MM. Have you ever seen fights? B no. I was supposed to do it. I received Okinawa's order to go to a CAV unit, which encouraged me, and they pulled me from that and they stuck to me in a future unit of combat systems, not deployable. And it upset me a little because I never considered myself a soldier because I have never been able to deploy. I have always felt inadequate not to have these stories of this camaraderie that other soldiers had with each other, to have the experience of being abroad in Iraq or Afghanistan. Has civil life. B I always adapt. A good. What did you do after the army? B I went to school, I studied welding. How did the army service change you? B I don't really know. How have you been feeling lately? B from top to bottom. Today has been broken down. I had bad dreams last night and some racing thoughts. I try a little. I have the impression of seeing the signs of other people, you know, who appreciate me more and appreciate me more and have supported me more, you know, crossing everything and which are really attentive, and I feel like not to repel them, but I feel that there are. There is a push and a draw in a situation. Instead of allowing me to fall into the situation, I am. I get away from it. You know, this is not a bad situation, but it is. There is a no. There is an uncertainty that I feel, that I am badly controlled about my thoughts. And I don't even do it. I can't even. I'm not even talking about them. I do not even say, hey, you know, because I feel that I am wrong and that if I do it, it will be embarrassed, not an embarrassing moment, but that will change the whole situation of something. So I don't want to cross this border, which is a bit. It is. It's so right there on my face, but yet I don't look at it. And it's frustrating. It's good.

B i fan, I. I transform it into jokes. I will write or meditate. I forget that I was it. I started to meditate again and it really helped. It's still. Doctors don't really listen to, which is really frustrating, especially since I'm under medication and it really plays me because I'm sure. I should take different medication. What I am now, the drugs they have played on to me is to play with my mood. It's fair. It is a big mixture and I need to be more assertive and I try not to be so aggressive and asserted, but just to let them know, hey, that is what must happen. Can you repeat the question? What made me ask for help? Well, I was on one. I crossed a spiritual journey and my mother did not love him. Who seems hard. Are you still in therapy now? B yes. A good. Do you think therapy is useful? B yeah, highly. Can you tell me? B Well, I am able to do it. I am able to get more at the bottom of things. I am able to understand myself a little better. Capable of better understanding the problems of things. R when is the last time you felt really happy? B really happy?

There's so many things to really like about la. A Yeah. What are some things you don't really like about la? B See a lot of congestion and pollution. A I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B I. I try to, but no, I don't. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B It's nice to be in the open road with plenty of time to think about my own life. A Uh huh. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Shy. A Why? B Sometimes I find it hard to express my own thoughts. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B Well, you mentioned a fish tank and I've spent some time in many waiting rooms where there's been fish tanks. So staring at fish tanks could be one of them. But I also enjoy walking or lifting weights, reading, going to movies, just to say a few things. A That's good. How are you at controlling your temper? B Good. Moderate. Good. In control. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Argued? A. About today. Okay, last argument was today, just before I got here. And it was about having. About. How do I say this? About taking them to a bus stop. About how making an arrangement. A Okay, what's something you feel guilty about? B Feel guilty about not taking better care of my pet. A Can you Tell me about that. B I like birds, so one of my pets was a bird as of recently, and I let my bird out into the wild and sort of wish I had planned for a better future for the. For the bird only because now I sort of wish the bird was closer to me. A I see. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Hmm. I would say I get into arguments with people close to me, friends, and sometimes I don't handle them well. I am more reactive. So I wish I'd like to see myself improve on that. A Has that gotten you in trouble? B No. At least not, you know, not in any sort of legal trouble, but I think it's, you know, it's kind of not the way that I would like to have handled it. A Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had. Had to make. B Wow. Guess the hardest decision was about to. Of how to proceed with moving forward on a job opportunity. A Tell me about that. B I had to decide whether if I would suffer more emotional pain by leaving my family and whether the financial gain and knowledge of that experience would outweigh the benefit. A That sounds really hard. Are you happy you did that? B Yes. Yes, I am. A That's good. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B Well, it's a small family, but I have a mother and a sister and a brother and two younger nieces. Older. They're grown adults. It's a good relationship and things could be better. Sometimes it's sort of difficult, painstaking relationships at times. There's some days I'm. I need time for myself, and I would rather give the time to other people rather than to take time for myself, which has been my experience. And so that has caused me a lot of emotional pain, a little bit spiritual anxiety about my future if I continue to do that sort of thing. A Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Wow. There's so many things. What about you? I don't know anything about you. I would say. Well, there's. There's a few, but of recent, I. Wow. Things are going pretty good. I can't really say there's anything as of yet that I would really want to change or have anything to regret on that I can remember. A Okay. How easy is it to. For you to get a good night's sleep? B It's been pretty good, and I'd say it's okay. I'm handling my sleep pretty well. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B When I don't sleep well, sometimes I can Be irritable. Sometimes it's okay. And I would say if there's also times where I'm unhappy. So I try to get as much sleep as I need. A Okay. Have you ever served? A. B Yes. A How old were you when you joined the military? B I believe I was 19, and. A I'm. B Glad I did it. A You were very young, weren't you? B Yes, sort of, but yes. A Did you ever see combat? B No. A How did serving in the military change you? B Well, I guess. I suppose it made me a more confident person and more in tune with the country that I'm living in and people to be more noticeable, more watchful of where I live. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Hanging out with some friends on a really nice weekend and on a boat or on a skiff. Really small boat. And trying to fish and. A Nice. How did you feel in that moment? B I felt free or alive. Happy, uninhibited, strong, confident, mature. A What did you do after the military? B After the military. After military. Took some time to evaluate my thoughts and my future and just sort of took the necessary steps to move ahead. A How hard is that? B It's sort of hard. It is. A How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? B It wasn't easy. A lot of family help and community and so it took some adjusting, but it wasn't easy. A I understand. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B You know, this week, partially today. Happy. Happy. Sort of. Often not too happy, but content. Happy. Happy. I don't know. Not usually too happy. Try to stay on the center line. A Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B Ideal weekend? Up early. Get out, enjoy the day. Hook up with some friends and do a little bit of socializing and maybe get some food. Form of view, some form of artistic expression. A Like what? B There's a. Maybe like a museum. Stare at some art or maybe something in the local community. Maybe street art and. Or perhaps something with music or something. Something of that nature. A Okay. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B I wish perhaps some things that I could change about myself. Be more decisive about decisions. And something else that I had the same ability for. Enact. For meeting more people, I suppose. A How would your best friend describe you? B As my best friends describe me. I don't know. Nice, friendly, trustworthy, sociable. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B The same advice I gave myself today. A Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Something. Wow. I really enjoyed spending time with my girlfriend and her two children. That was yesterday and I'm glad I did that. It was a good time for everybody. A That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? B I'm proud of when it's in military and I'm glad I did that. It's a good experience. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. B Bye. Thank you. A That's sort of freaky.

"A Okay, once again. Once she says goodbye, just press that button. B Okay? A Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yeah. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing all right. How are you doing? A That's good. Where are you from originally? B Northern Illinois. A Really? When'd you move to LA? B 2 and a half years ago. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B I haven't yet since I've been here. A Why? B Haven't had a chance to. Gonna go back later this year. A How does it come compared to la? B Colder or warmer. A I see what you mean. Why'd you move to la? B Work. A Are you happy you did that? B Yeah. A How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B Took a little while, but I got used to it. A Can you tell me about that? B No weather variations, comparative traffic, sunlight. A I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B A little bit. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Seeing different things. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B Been to Europe a couple of times. Been around the country, visiting Yosemite and Sequoia. Parks were fun. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Depends on the circumstance. Most of the time I can fake outgoing or try to be outgoing. A What do you do when you're annoyed? B Try to relax and breathe through it and move on. A How are you at controlling your temperature? B Depends on the context. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Probably yesterday. And my children. About them not doing what they were told to do. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Arguments with my wife, where I should have probably been more patient and understanding. A Can you give me an example of that? B Hmm. Sometimes when it's more of a hormonal period, like this week, I should just probably breathe through things and recognize that she's going through things and I should just be more patient. A Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had. B What I was going to do with my life. A How did you decide to do that? B It was easy. When I was 19, I could just decide to do strange, difficult things and had the boldness to follow through with them. A What did you study at school? B Hebrew and Semitic studies and classics. A That sounds interesting. B Are you still working in that kind of. A What's your dream job? B I'm in ministry. And that's working out the way I kind of want it to be. A That's good. Tell me about an event or something. Something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Hmm. Some embarrassing things when I was a teenager, probably. A Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B It's pretty strong. A How close are you to your family? B I talk to my parents about once a day, maybe once every other day. And I'm constantly talking with my wife and children. A Tell me about your kids. B I've got four of them. They keep me very busy between nine and three. A Do you find it easy to be a parent? B Sometimes. Most of the time, no. A What's the hardest thing about being a parent? B Character development. Recognizing that they need space to grow. A What's the best thing about being a parent? B When it works. And you see character development and growth and exploration. A What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? B I have more standards, more willingness to enforce standards. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B My wife. A Can you tell me about that? B She's been there for me for 15 years now and I help give me the self confidence to be who I am. A That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Better now that I'm not drinking as much pop at night. Irritable, Shorter temper. Pretty good. Pretty good. I'm doing. Been making some better decisions with my diet. Just doing better. A That's great. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts? Maybe. B Feel a bit more empowered. Not as defeatist. I was in a process where I wasn't eating very well, wasn't exercising, wasn't able to get doing those things. I've been doing a little better at that recently. The past few weeks. And that's been a little bit more encouraging. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Nope. A Tell me about the last time. Felt really happy. B Really happy. Probably a few weeks ago at the beach when everybody was having a good time. Confident, loud, intelligent. I guess. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B More patient, more. More able to automatically engage with people as opposed to being hesitant at first. A Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. B Oh, middle school, when I was always the low man in the totem pole. Socially being the constant butt of jokes. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Don't fall in the trap of thinking that middle and high school is life. A Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B Sometime, you know, with children and family, doing some fun activity, beach or museum or something. Some time with the wife sometime just by myself to read and kind of refocus. A Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoy. B Participate in some high level academic discussions. Hmm. That I've been able to maintain the standard and quality of life for myself and my family that I've been able to do so far. A That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to.

"A good. Repair my hair. Great. THANKS. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? A yes. B ok. So how are you today? A good. B is good. Where do you come from? A New York. B really? Why did you move to it? Has to continue the music industry. Work in the music industry. B Do you still work in there? A yes. B What are you doing now? A I am independent. B Anyway. What is your dream work? Has to become a music producer. B awesome. How difficult is it? A it's quite difficult. There is a lot of competition. B Why did you move to the? Has to continue a job. B When did you move to the? When? About a year ago. Last February. B How easy for you to get used to living in it? It was quite difficult. The east coast is very different from the west coast. B How often do you return to your hometown? R I think I went there twice in the past year. B is good. Do you travel a lot? One no, I'm more a creature usually. B ok. Do you consider yourself introverted? A yes. B Why? Sometimes I feel like I don't integrate myself into the crowd. It is therefore better to be calmer and see everything instead of going and actively pursuing things. B What are you doing to relax? Probably listening to music and spending time with my dogs. B What are the things that are really going crazy? A people probably in. Not very, very kind to me or see. See injustices or. I think that's it. B How are you going to control your temperament? A pretty good. When will you go back the last time you argued with someone? A few days ago. One of my friends said they were commenting on how I am and I got a little upset about it. Yeah, this is the case. B How far are you close? A fairly close. My best friend. So I'm just. One of my friends. B What are you doing when you are annoyed? R I am a little calm on this subject. And when a person pushes me to a certain point, that's when I react excessively. You generally. B How difficult is it? A it's quite difficult. Rather, I notice that the person notices that I am somehow withdrawn and that I actively commit to myself instead of doing so in the point where it is. This is a point where it explodes of proportion. Uh, probably spend time with my family. In New York. B Ho W are you in your family? A very close. B is good. Who is a positive influence in your life? A UM, my sister and my brother. B tell me more about it. In uh, I don't know. They are only great people, and I love them very much and they are a lot like me, so I feel like I have people who understand me. B is good. How would your best friend describe you? In um, probably, I suppose, loyal, sensitive. I don't know. It's a bit difficult. This is a difficult question. B ok. Have you ever served in the army? A number B Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? A number B Have you received a diagnosis of depression? A yes. B For how long have you been diagnosed? A God, I probably think of 1997. A long time ago. B What made you ask for help. A during this time? I was just doing many problems and I felt dangerous for me, so I ended up going to the doctor to get medication and have therapy and stuff. Not currently. Ended, like six months ago. B Why did you stop? R I thought the therapist didn't really help me. I felt that we continued to talk about the same things again and again, and she didn't really challenge me. And I’ve been in therapy for a very long time, so I just knew it was a change. It's good. B Do you feel that therapy is useful? R Yes, I do, actually. When I feel connected to a therapist, I have the impression that it is a very good way for me to talk about what I go through. So, yes, I do it. B What kind of changes have you noticed since you are going? R I am better to describe my emotions and my feelings. I think the most important thing is that when I am in situations, I can see myself reacting in a way and I take a step back and I see how I can normally react almost in a way. In addition, I tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and bury them and make them feel, like, really bad to me. It is therefore nice to speak to someone who does not judge. It doesn't really tell me, like, you know, they tell me it's okay. Basically, feeling desperate all the time, not having, you know, enough energy to do things. I used to conduct some concentration problems. Having strange and disturbing thoughts sometimes comes to mind and, on the whole, feeling just a little shabby in life. Sometimes they are like random moments. If there is, as, a problem with, like my interpersonal life or something like that, or if I sometimes see something on television, sometimes it affects me. B How do you face this? Listening to music or tryi NG to distract me? Try, as my therapist told me for the longest time to record things. B How have you been feeling lately? R was a difficult transition to come here. So, well, to be here. So a kind of half and half good and disagree. B Have you noticed changes in your behavior? R I feel like I was a little more withdrawn lately, but that's about it. B ok. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? A few days it's great, some days, this is not the case. More recently, it was a little more difficult. I don't know why. I have a lot of thoughts on my mind at night, so I tend not to sleep very well. And I wake up quite frequently during the night, very groggy in the morning and that's it. As during the day, I tend to yawn a lot. And my friends are always like, why are you yawning so much? Are you disinterested in what we are doing? And I try to tell them that it is not at all. B ok. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? A Christmas period probably when I was with my family. Really very happy and have the impression that everything was fine in my life. To have a good sense like where I was at this moment, to be present with myself. B is good. How about that of your best comedies are? One probably, you know, let's see. This is a difficult question. I think I probably tend to read people well sometimes. And I like to say that I am good to be a good friend for people, to be a good member of the family. I am a hard worker when I have a job. SO. Of course. I mean, it's life. So of course, there are regrets. The one who comes to mind is that I want me to eat as much, so I can be much healthier. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Don't take things if seriously. Take advantage of being young. And I think that's it. B ok. What are you most proud of in your life? R I don't know. This is a good question. Probably my previous work and my job. I worked very well with the children, so I did a great job for this. I was a researcher in a hospital and I have helped many children for about six years, so seven years. B WOW, it seems interesting. Yeah, it was great. B How did you decided to do this? R I was really inclined to read people and I therefore decided to specialize in psychology, therefore. And then I went to work in a mental health establishment and I did research with them with drugs and depression and things like that. He therefore discovered, like a good niche for me. B it's great. All right. I think I asked everything I need. A good. B Thank you for sharing your thoughts. A problem without problem.

R I read and listen to soft music, like jazz or something like that. B What are the things that are really going crazy? R I don't like people to walk in front of me, don't say, excuse me, cut to traffic when I drive. I don't like a tailgate. Small comments, like small remarks that people can make that can bother me. I don't like being. I am easily aggravated, so I don't like to be aggravated. B What are you doing when you are boring? How are you doing? R I am good enough to control it sometimes, but sometimes I can become very furious. So I'm working on this right now. B is good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it? At Oh, I haven't discussed for almost a year. But when I did it, it was on a girl. He was my ex -boyfriend, it was on a woman. But it's over now, so I haven't had real arguments for almost a year. I studied at university. I did the development of the child and I also studied computer science. B What are you doing now? At the moment, I am a housewife. I don't work at all. I haven't worked for about three months now. Was dismissed, but I was doing a receptionist work. So I'm currently looking for a job on this subject moment. B it's great. What is your dream work? A work of my dream is to have my own design computer store. Which means when you do your. You graphic your conceptions online and you send them to different distributors and what they do is that they approve or they approve or disapprove of what they like or do not like in my creations, if they want to go ahead, they will buy them and then they will go from there. B really. Do you travel a lot? One no, I was doing it in the past, but not for the moment. B What is one of your most memorable experiences? R When I went to Hawaii with my daughter and my mother, it was very delicious. We stayed for almost two weeks, and it was not even two years ago. It was very, very nice. And I would like to be able to go back. The beaches were beautiful, the food is great. The Luaus were great at night. It was really, really nice. A great experience. B it's great. How far are you from your family? A very close. My mother and daughter are all three of us. We are like sisters. We could not be closer. My parents, my grandparents who have left, their past, but they have had a very positive influence in my life. My friend with whom I go out now, he is very positive in my life, so I have a lot of backbone, support. You can say that I don't do it for the moment because I live with my mother and stepfather. I try to move for myself now, but it's a bit difficult, does not work at all. So I just have to pass it until I can do better. B Do you have roommates? A no, it's just myself, my daughter, my mother and my stepfather right now. B ok. Have you ever served in the army? No, I didn't do it. B ok. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? A yes, I have. B For how long have you been diagnosed? Almost two years now. No, I had no idea. Always feeling on the ground and going out, hanging on, not wanting to be disturbed with other outside world. Just small mood swings and can't sleep at night. All the little things that made me feel that something was not part of me. Yes I do it. B ok. Yes, I do it. It is very useful. B ok. Is going to a therapist help you? R This is the case, a lot. The reason why I have the impression that it helps me is because the lady I see there instead of therapy, she is very kind. She. She is ready to help any possible ways. She is almost for me like a psychiatrist. She is very good. I mean, she tells me about things, encourages me not to do, what to do to help calm down, to feel better. And she's just very nic e. Overall, I always remain confident all the time. Number one, my mood oscillates. I noticed a big change in this and my attitude. B Okay, how did the therapist affect you? To that affected me in a great way. I would never say negative because as I said, it comes back to the help I received from the lady and the therapist and the different ways that I have been trained on how to improve my lifestyle to avoid the problem I have at this moment that I suffer. This is how it affected me this way. Attitudes, the atmosphere oscillate. I couldn't sleep at night, depressed all the time, not at all outdoor company. I didn't want to be disturbed with someone, friends or family. Locked in my room all the time, halfway not wanting to eat or eat too much. It was just a lot. Maybe like any little thing would trigger me. As if someone could tell me something wrong that I think I was thinking badly. He was just going to trigger. I would just be triggered and I would not be without reason. It's fair. I don't know what caused him apart. B it's great. How do you face this? A well, now I do. I take care of that by not slamming as much and just trying to stay calm. And I just need a lot of positive environment around me, no negativity. It also helps. So, that being said, I maintain in a way and keep my high self -esteem as much as possible. B well. How do you feel recently? Much better than before. B is good. Have you noticed changes in your behavior or your thoughts? R Yes, I have very positive thoughts. Very positive behavior. Much better than it was. A very great improvement from the front. B you often feel this way? R Yes, I have been it for a few months. I feel a little better. I sometimes, but today, no, I feel quite optimistic. It's not very easy, but I'm trying. But for a few nights, I have slept all night. It is therefore a positive for me. Very grumpy, very groggy, in a bad mood. In fact, yesterday, I received good news by phone and I was happy all day. I'm still a little happy today. So it was very good for me. My best friend is a man and he would probably describe me as optimistic, always ready to leave, likes to eat. Just a funny person to rub shoulders. No, I don't regret anything. B ok. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. A thank you for doing me. B Goodbye. A farewell. It was great. I love him.

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll answer questions, get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Yes. C Okay. So how are you doing today? A I'm doing pretty good. C That's great. Where are you from originally? A Originally, I was born in Denver, Colorado. C What are some things you really like about O? A I like the beach, sunshine, pretty girls, the ocean. Lot of things. C What are some things you don't really like about la? A Smog, excess amount of people in traffic that can be dealt with. I would like to travel more. C What do you enjoy now? A Traveling, seeing new things and learning perhaps a new culture or something. Oh, okay. I. When I was younger I went to Europe and just did the backpacking thing. Backpacked around Europe for a little while and it was real fun. C What's one of your most memorable experiences? A Probably just being in the military with some friends and stuff like that. C What do you study at school? A Well, I have a degree in film and I'm finishing a degree in OR for business as well. C What do you do now? A Now I look for work. I'm trying to do some sort of entrepreneurial effort now as I finish my business degree. C What's your dream job? A It'd probably be to own my own company. That's kind of why I want some sort of entrepreneurial effort to push forward with some sort of interesting product or service that I'd be working on. C Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A I would say middle of the road, a little bit shy and at times can be takes a wild warm up. C Why? A I just cautious to meet someone new and then from there kind of see where to go from there, I guess. C Tell me about your Relationship with your family? A My family, they still live in Colorado. They're interesting people and good as well. I talk to them probably a couple times a week. They're good people. I have one brother and he has a couple kids and he's married as well. C Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? A That's a good question. Lately I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise, like just jogging or riding a bike. I recently got a bike, something like that. On a daily effort, for the most part, pretty good. I try to. If I have an outburst or if I'm being irritable, I try to stay away from people because I don't like to go off on people they didn't do anything wrong or change the topic in my mind. I guess what gets me in trouble would be more I avoid things and it kind of builds up and becomes worse and that kind of gets the trouble. Yeah. C When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? A Basically just in a relationship, arguing with a girlfriend. To be honest with you, I don't remember exactly what it was about. It's just probably one of us is being irritable and me and going from there, or it's probably a lot to do with money as well. I don't have the best financial security at this point. C That you wish you would handle differently about. A That's a good question. I guess I do harbor a little bit of guilt from the military as far as is getting out and people are still in, I suppose. But no, that's. That's not for me anymore. C Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Okay, tell me about an event or if something that you wish you could erase from your memory. A Let me think. Well, I used to work for a friend and I invested into his company and the economy went down. It was a construction accessory company basically, and economy went down and we lost most of our money like most of the folks around America. And that pretty much it was a good and bad thing. I guess you gotta look at it from a good, good perspective. But it definitely put myself in a tailspin financially and couldn't really do anything about it. Almost was homeless for a little while. But I wish I wouldn't have invested into the company and just move forward and perhaps gone to school like I'm going anyway. Anyway. C Have you ever served in the military? A I have. C How old were you? A I was 21. I wanted a change in life. I wanted some more real world experiences, served my country and also the added benefits of going to school were nice. I didn't have much financial capabilities at that time and I wanted to change to get out of my current situation. And that was the best way out, I thought. C Are you happy you did that? A Yeah, yeah, I'm very happy I joined the military. I appreciate it now more that I'm out and understanding kind of what I suppose war was about is definitely changing people and myself as well. C Did you ever see combat? A Yeah, I did a tour both in Iraq and Afghanistan as well. C How easy was it for me to go back to civilian life? A Let's see, I thought at first it was very easy, and then I came to understanding it was very difficult just because I was adjusting from military life instead having that in my head and not until now. I realized that probably just a few months ago to, you know, reintegrate myself a little bit better into civilian life, which it's. It's actually. It's actually pretty difficult. No problem. Let me think. I. When I got out of the military first is I. I invested, like I said, into my friend's company and we started that little business. We were doing well for a little while, working and then lost all of our money. And then I traveled for a while, which I understand now is obviously some other issues, but I traveled all over America working and went to school in New York for a little while, lived in a few different states and came back to Canada, California, where I'm finishing school, finally living the dream. C How did serving in the military change you? A That's a good question. I would say. Well, it instills you with very good, I think, a sense of. Sense of character and strength and, you know, I think there's a lot of good qualities that the military, our military, puts into people, but at the same time, it puts a lot of bad qualities as well, because you need some sort of edge or something that you need on a most daily basis. And if you don't get that, then, you know, a lot of guys, you know, turn into drinking or drugs just because you can't get that same edge and that really. That can really either hurt or benefit you. C How have you been feeling lately? A I've been feeling okay. I've had a bit of a sinus issue lately, but I've been feeling okay. C Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? A Actually, my thoughts. I used to really have scattered thoughts and I Would say I'm starting to get a little bit better clarity, which is good. Taken a lot of different therapy and stuff like that, and it's actually helped. C Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? A It varies. I can't really. The tough part for me is the schedule because that's. If I'm not tired, you don't sleep. Sleep. You just lay there. It's hit or miss, really. Some nights I can sleep pretty well. Some nights I have to wait till I'm exhausted. And I don't like doing pills. Pills are bad. I understand that. But it's basically just can't sleep because either you're. My mind's always thinking about something or something I feel that I have to do, but yet I'm not doing anything. That's not true. I'm trying to always do something or. Yeah, I mean, I do have some troubling dreams at times, but that doesn't really negate me from sleeping. Sleeping. It wakes me up is what it does, because it can be the dream that you remember versus the one that you don't. C Sleep well. A When I don't sleep well, perhaps irritability and anxiety definitely go up. I definitely get. I have a tendency to get a lot of headaches, and not sleeping very well definitely puts that into the mix. C Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? A I have. C Okay. Have you been diagnosed with depression? A Not that I know of. No. C When was the last time you felt really happy? A Hmm. I don't know. Try to feel happiness on a daily basis, I guess would be a good answer, but I'm not certain. C That'S good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? A I'll say my dad's been a very positive influence. C How would your best friend describe you? A That's a good question. Charismatic, fun guy, pretty tough, probably a good worker, I'd say. I really enjoyed jogging the other day on the beach. C What are you most proud of in your life? A Hmm. Something that I am most proud of, I would say. I'm actually an online minister as well. And I married my brother and his wife, and that was a pretty proud experience. C Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. A She said goodbye. It's all right. She's very understandable. B Shut everything down. You can move over there. C Okay.

I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. C Okay. B Are you okay with this? C Yes. B Okay. So how are you doing today? C I'm doing good. B That's great. Where are you from originally? C Brooklyn, New York. B What are some things you really like about la? C The sun, the weather, a lot of the people, the beach. B What are some things you don't really like about la? C I see what you mean, some of the people. B Do you travel a lot? C I like to, whenever I can. I'm a big fan of traveling. B What do you enjoy about traveling? C Visiting new places, meeting other people, eating different food, seeing other cultures, that kind of stuff. B I'd like to hear about one of your trips. C I went to Spain recently and that's a little bit of a more laid back lifestyle. They don't work the same amount of hours as Americans, different culture, they take a lot of breaks, rests during the middle of the day, especially in the summer when it's really hot. Totally different food style culture. They go out to bars and restaurants a lot later, stays open later and you know, it's just something new. It was exciting and you know, I look forward to seeing other types of destinations like that. B What's one of your most memorable experiences? C Going to Spain with all my old high school friends. I hadn't seen them in a while and we did a big tour of Spain. We went to Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia. Had a great time, you know, spent a couple weeks out there and you know, got to relax and have fun. B What did you study at school? C I was a Computer science major. B What do you do now? C I do IT consulting. B Okay. What's your dream job? C Dream job? Probably I want to start moving into finance. I want to do something financial related. Investment banking. I think I'm going to switch course pretty soon here. B Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? C I'm a little bit more shy. B How about your relationship with your family? C My family is good. We're a little bit closed. We don't show a lot of emotion and we're not as loving over the phone or in person. But we have other ways to show our emotions. B Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. C Yeah. B What do you do to relax? C Usually I'll just watch a movie or go to the movies, go to the park. I have a small dog, so I like taking him around the block. So that usually relaxes me a bit. B How are you at controlling your temper? C I'm usually pretty good. I don't really get extremely angry very often. You know, I keep a lot of my emotions inside, which isn't always good. But, you know, I never have crazy angry outbursts and get violent or anything like that. B When was the last. Last time you argued with someone and what was it about? C The last time I argued with someone was a few weeks ago. We were actually in Las Vegas and, you know, we were with a big group of people and we were just trying to decide where to go. And one of my friends was pretty adamant about one place and it was unappealing to the rest of the group. So, you know, it got a little confrontational, but everything worked out in the end. B Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. C I think the passing of my mom's dad. I wish I would have been a little more loving and emotional to my mom about it. You know, it was a very difficult time for her and I should have been there a little bit more than I was. B What's something you feel guilty about? C I feel guilty about just not being as loving and caring to my parents. I mean, they've done a lot for me and provided a lot. And I don't always really show my appreciation to them. I think as much as I wish I should. So. B Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. C The hardest decision I ever. B Or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. C Something that I wish was erased would certainly be when I was pulled over for a dui. Very Embarrassing moment, but, you know, I wish that had never happened. B Have you ever served in the military? C No. B How have you been feeling lately? C I've been a little bit sad. Had another death in the family recently. My uncle passed away a couple weeks ago. So it's been a little bit difficult on all of us. And you know, we're all spread out around the country, so it's tough. We can't really be together in person, so makes it difficult. B I'm sorry to hear that. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? C Just recently. I mean, I think I've been a little more bummed out and, you know, down a little bit more than, you know, normal. So, you know, I'm sure it'll turn around soon, but sometimes some of these things just take time to heal. B Tell me more about that. C Well, you know, whenever you lose someone close to you in a family, you know, it's very difficult for everyone and you know, different people show their emotions differently. So, you know, for me I tend to keep a lot of it in and, you know, it'd be a little more beneficial if I was able to express it to someone more. But, you know, I don't really feel comfortable doing that all the time. So hopefully things get better. B How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? C It's very difficult because I work a lot of strange hours too. So I'm up, you know, working late and then got to get up early and sometimes I can sleep in more. So, you know, if I'm not in a set routine, it makes it a little more difficult but. But I usually get a decent amount of sleep as often as possible, so I usually don't have too much trouble in that sense. B What are you like when you don't sleep well? C If I don't sleep well, I'm usually a little. Just bit more irritable, more grumpy. Smaller things can set me off a little bit, but I have certain techniques to relax a little bit more.

They've always been there for me. I've gone through a lot of tough times when I was younger and they've always been there to support me and that's really meant a lot, so that's really kept me going.

I was created to speak to Ken in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started and do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. B ok. Do you agree with that? B Certainly. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. A little tired and I had a pizza, so I'm a little sleepy at the moment. And other than that, I'm fine. A it's good. Where do you come from? B I was born. So I grew up at. A good. What are the things you really like? B see. What does I like at? I like the beaches, I like time. I like the fact that there are a lot of jobs here that there are not in many other states. Like beautiful women and that's it. What are the things you don't really like at it? B see. I don't like. I don't like smog, I don't like overcrowded highways. I don't like the crime rate, violence,. The economy is a bit difficult to manage. Things, things of this nature. Yeah. R I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? B I used to. Used to travel everywhere, state to declare. I was a truck driver at some point, so I used to drive a diesel truck. So I went to many different states, I saw a lot of different things, but more so. I am sort of a body at home now. What do you like in travel? B I like to see. I like to see new things, new people, new places like food, time, everything. I love to see again and live new things. A I would like to hear about one of your trips. B one of my trips? Let's see, let's see. In fact, one of my trips I had was a bit interesting. Was. I didn't do it. Well, in addition to traveling through the United States was. I went to Mexico. It was rather interesting. And I didn't have the biggest exp Erience in Mexico because I got, excuse me, I was stolen my car in Mexico. So I was not, I didn't have time there, but I enjoyed the Baja. This is where I went was Baja right next to Tijuana. I appreciated the fish there, the tacos, things like that. What are your most memorable experiences? B one of my most memorable experiences. Let's see. What did you study at school? B What did I study at school? I studied, I went for my BSBM diploma, but I did not finish my diploma. What are you doing now? B now I am a disabled veterinarian. I spent a lot of time writing, poetry to write a certain number of different things, to spend time with family, to cycle, to enjoy a lot, to read, I like to read, I love spending time with the family, things like that. At uh huh. What is your dream work? B My dream work. Let's see. My dream job, I used to do a lot of workman's composition surveys where I made workman fraud and I checked people who were lying and that insurance companies were relaxing for money. And I enjoyed it. I have done it for years. It was roughly my dream work. I loved it. I made surveillance, I reported the writing, I did infiltration work. I did all kinds of different things at some point. So it would be my dream work. Do you consider yourself more shy or out? B at the moment, I feel like I am out, but generally I'm shy. These are social scenes. Often, I'm shy, but right now I don't feel shy. Right now, I feel comfortable talking to you. A Tell Me on your relationship with your family. B I was adopted, so my relationship with my family did not really go well. So I'm not really close to my adopted family and I have a limited biological family, so I don't really have a lot of family. But the very rare I have, I love them very much and I try to spend as much time with them as possible. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I listen to music and I pray. I pray for me to listen to music and I just meditate on positive things. Make a walk, cycle, read a book, things like that. How are you going to control your temperament? B was not very good in this area. But over the years, going through difficult times and learning the hard way, I learned to control my temperament quite well. Now it takes a lot to get me. To get angry. I'm more passive now than ever, and I like it for me. When was the last time there Or argued with someone and what was it? B I argued with my best friend. It was probably not like a really serious argument, but we discussed a little about religion, in which I do not like to enter, or I do not like to enter the arguments, but unfortunately, we argued on religion. She wanted me to do it. She wants me to join her religion. I do not have the impression that this is what I should do. And so we had a small dispute on this subject. To tell me about a situation you want you to manage differently. B see. There are many, a lot, many situations that I would like to manage differently, and one of them was my children. I would have liked to be. I would have liked to be a better father for my children. I would have liked to be able to make better decisions for my children, and I did not do it. R which you feel guilty? B I feel guilty about it. Not to be a good parent for my children several times in my life. And this guilt remains with me all my life. Every day I think about it. A MM. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to make. B see. The most difficult decision I ever had to make. Tell me about Nicole or something that. You want you to erase from your memory. B I want to be able to erase from my memory the last time that divorce would be one of the last things. Or the memory of this wrong relationship was probably one of the last things. Excuse me. One of the things I would like to erase from my memory the last time I interacted with my ex-wife. Have you ever served in the army? B Yeah, I was in the navy. At what age were you when you joined the army? B I was 18 years old. Just a child. A why did you decided to enlist you in the army? B Well, to be honest with you, I was 18 years old and I was nowhere else. I was homeless, and it was either homeless on the street at 18, or join the army and try to do something in my life. And that's what I chose to do. Are you happy that you did that? B yeah, in a way. Going out, you know, I got out. I got out of the army and I would have liked to stay longer. So, yes, in the end, yes, I'm happy to have done it. Have you ever seen fights? B No, I have never seen a fight. I was in an 86 and 87 these years, and I was in the era of the Cold War. I was parked on the. And my ship was dry for a while, so I didn't see a fight. They had no fight at that time. To what extent was you easy to go back to civilian life? B I think it was too easy for me. I adjusted. In fact, I adjusted Really well come out and come back to civilian life. I entered it with both feet walking. And so, yes, it was not at all difficult. What did you do after the army? B after the army, I worked several different jobs by looking at and thinking about the career I wanted to choose. I applied for the Sheriff department. Did not do the Sheriff department, but he entered work for various private investigative companies at that time. And that's how I ended up working and entering workman fraud and various aspects of surveillance and investigation of the private survey. So I worked a little private time after leaving the army. How did the army service change you? B It taught me the honor. It taught me dignity. It taught me respect. It taught me to listen and obey a chain of command. It sort of grew up me. It grew up from a child to a man in many ways. As I said, I would have liked to have stayed longer to have grown more, but I didn't do it. How have you been feeling lately? B recently, I really really feel, I don't know, just a little worthless, you know, a lot depressed, a little worthless. Not. I do not feel, I do not know, maybe a little hope in many ways, without knowing what my future has in store for us, I suppose you could say. And, I don't know, I just feel a little depressed. In the past two weeks. Have you noticed changes in his behavior or his process of reflection? B Yeah, I just feel a little desperate and just depressed and not having a lot of energy and as I said, I just feel depressed. I just feel on the ground, not feeling worthy, you know, that kind of feelings. A good. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B depends on the night. Sometimes me. I sleep very well. Other nights are agitated. I have bad dreams, things like that. But in recent times, I have just felt depressed. I slept too much. How are you when you don't sleep well? B Sometimes I become irritable. I can't think directly. My mind is a clutter. I can't think directly. And irritable and perhaps grumpy. Things like that. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B yes. Yes. In fact, I take medication for it. I have been advice for that and I’ve been dealing with it for a while now. But yes, I was diagnosed with an SSPT. How long have you been diagnosed? B Excuse me. Several years ago. My headphones stand out a bit, but yes, several years ago. What was your sym Ptoms? B Tremors at night, nightmares, depression. Feeling. Feeling something wrong will happen to me at any time. You know, that's what I felt when I was in the army. I felt like our ship was going to be bombed at any time. Just be. Feel a feeling of terror most of the time. Are they triggered by something? B no. This is the strange part on this subject. It's fair. That's just what I feel. I don't know why it's like that. I can't tell you. But that's what I have been feeling for years. Since I have been in the army. I feel like that now. As if we are going to be bombed. Something will happen at any time. Chaos will break out, things like that. And I hate that. I want it not like that. I would have liked not to think that way. How do you face them? B isolate sometimes and try to do it. I pray. I believe in God, so I pray. And I try to have it comfort and help myself to cross the frightening feelings I feel. I try to get the support of the little friends I have and some family members I have. I'm just trying to tell myself that everything will be fine. This is not what I think, you know. Things are not the way I think they are in my head. These kinds of adaptation mechanisms. What made you ask for help? B I could no longer bear it. I had depressed. I found myself in the hospital. As I said, feeling of terror. Be afraid all the time. Couldn't. I couldn't face it anymore. So I ended up getting help and I am happy to have done it. And it's a daily struggle. I always find it difficult to manage. But I'm fine. I hang on there. Who seems hard. B it's very hard. Are you going to always in therapy now? B Yeah, yeah, I go to therapy as probably once a month. I take medication for that. It helps me a lot. I should probably go to therapy more, but it is once a month at the moment. A good. Do you think therapy is useful? B I think it's useful. If you are serious about it and take it seriously and you have the right therapist and everything is. The good dynamic is there. I think it's very useful. Yeah. By telling me more about it. B well, I think if you just go, it will not help. If you are going to look for the real answers to get help, I think it will work. You will get help, things will work. But if you have the bad person to talk to, chemistry is not there or that education or any dynamic involved does not work. They are not synchronized with each other, nor o In your side or the therapist, it will be more difficult than the solution is positive, I think. I don't know. I don't know if I said it correctly, but basically, yes. What kind of changes have you noticed since you go to therapy? B What kind of changes have I noticed? I am more a positive person in fact than me than ever. Was completely negative for everything for so many years. I am more positive. I have more hope. Even if I have days of despair, I have more hope. I feel more safe in me and I feel like I have an outing. I have someone I could talk to, who will understand me and someone I could really understand. A good, when will go back the last time and you felt really happy? B you know. By telling me more about it. B I don't remember the last time I was very happy, to be honest with you. I don't remember. It is. I don't remember. It's been a long time. Who is a positive influence in your life? B see. My brother, my older brother. It is a real positive influence in my life. My best friend is a real super positive person in my life. Whenever I start to speak negative or look at things, she always reminds me, being positive, being positive. And it helps a lot. And she's there to encourage me. And these two people there play a big role in my life. How would your best friend describe you? B oh, boy. I think she would probably describe me as someone who needs to take things more seriously with regard to her health, her spirituality, her life herself. Someone who has a lot of problems but yet she care about it. To Tell Me on something you recently did that you really enjoyed. B See, something I did recently that I really enjoyed. That I really enjoyed. I enjoyed reviewing my brother's house and watching him see him working on his Harley Davidson. He built a Harley Davidson from zero. So I liked going there and seeing him almost finished building this Harley from the ground. It was something I really liked to do. A beautiful. What are you most proud of in your life?

He always tries to find my interest, I suppose. So what is your dream work? My dream work. It's a good one. I love working with children. So I would do it Ay probably a children's psychologist just because, you know, it's great, you know, to learn what is going on in young minds and, you know, how we could help children develop a better way, you know, to make children, you know or help, you know, to help them, you know, to grow in a positive way, I suppose, instead of loving the bad way. Yeah, just, you know, help children. It depends. It depends on the situation in which I am. Sometimes you know, I could be like a super outgoing and as, you know, and sometimes I could. It's fair. I could be silent or anything, and just pay attention, you know, if I am like in class or something else, I don't really like it, and there are everyone who speaks, I just prefer to stay away, you know, because I need something else on which to concentrate. Something else. You know, there is a moment in time for everything, I suppose. Yeah. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B UM, I like to kick the sofa and, like, read a good book. You know, put my mind to another, you know, galaxy or universe or situation, you know. It's pretty fun, you know, just, you know, reading and having just. Just you relax and you know, you feel good. A it's great. B Yeah, that is. It's just fun. I love to read. Do you have to control your temperament? B I agree with that. I'm not like the best, you know, the person who would control the temperament, you know, I do my best and I suppose that is all I could do until I continue to do better. But I'm not like the best. I mean, me. Sometimes I have my explosion, you know, but you know, I guess it's everyone. I'm not sure, you know, when. One last time you chatted with someone? B ah, huh. This is a good question. I don't remember. Let's see. Honestly, I don't remember. Maybe. My God, I don't know. Sometimes I am very passive that I like things because I mean, what is the point of doing a big problem of things, you know? So, huh. I don't know. Honestly, I can't tell you right now. Why are we not talking later? B of course. Yeah. Probably comes back to me. How can you feel guilty, uh. Eh. Well, I guess when I was younger, you know, could have been a better older sister, and I was not. And it makes me feel guilty for sure. You know, I could have been a better sister, a better model, you know, but I try My best now, so I'm trying to improve things and it works. Yeah. To Tell Me on an event or something you want to be able to erase from your memory. B oh, I suppose, huh? I don't know. I mean, I am the person I am because of the events that have occurred in my life. So, if I erase something, then that's right. There is something of me in my current self or, you know, that would change. And I don't know. I quite agree with the person I am now. I mean, you know, I don't think I would change an event. You know, I agree with what, you know, the ups and downs and the good and the evil that happened. A good. B yeah. R I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer in the world. Do you travel a lot? B I don't see your shoes, but I don't travel much. But I'm a bit like an explorer, I guess. I love to explore, like the smallest things. As if I go hiking, I leave the path and, you know, I find my way to the top, you know, in one way or another, and do it, you know, while traveling. I would love to do that, but I don't know, just, you know, circumstances always in my life that does not know, always something, you know, I get married, children, you know and all that. So it's a bit like, you know, it would be good, I suppose, you know, it would be good, you know, I love to camp. It's a bit like, you know, do a few days of camping and, you know, fishing. Yeah. R when is the last time that happened? B It was this summer. You know, my husband and I went to camp and it was really nice. It was just me and him, you know, and it was like no one. And it was beautiful because he was just in the middle of the woods with a beautiful lake. And, you know, it was. It was really nice. It's fair. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was, it was, it was really fun. It was like. I would love to start again, you know, right now. It would be great, you know, just go there. It's fair. I love the adventure of things, nature and life and, you know, overall. Yeah. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B is. It's easy. But lately, I haven't been able to sleep, like night right now because, I don't know, just, you know, just I'm lying there and I'm just, like, trying to go to sleep, and I'm just like, Oh. But finally I do it, you know, I'm just. I probably have, like, I need to position myself in another side of the bed. Like, sometimes I am. I'm in the head and I'm like, oh, I have to go to o the side. And once I position myself, I go, like, I will sleep, you know, but it's right. I have to find the right position for me. Yeah. How are you when you don't sleep? GOOD. B I'm tired. I am tired throughout the day, you know, but I try to shake it, you know, and just, like, I have the impression that it is a new day, you know, and just try to do the day I have as big as possible, you know, then try, like, sleeping the evening during the day, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just, you know, it's okay. I try to do it the best, I suppose. Otherwise, I'm just going to sleep throughout the day, which is zero. But yeah. A good. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. How have you been feeling lately? B I feel good. Yeah, I felt really good. You know, a lot in my life have, you know, I have a very good year so far, so I'm very happy with that. You know, everything is, you know, go well, you know. A it's great. B Yeah, that is. Except that I just got out of a cold and it was horrible. But it's just nature. My immune system must work harder. A right. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B super happy, it was when the doctor told me I was pregnant. You know, I was really, really happy about this. And I was like, ah, you know, it was really, really good, you know, very excited and just read what is going on with my body and what is going on with the baby. And it's very overwhelming and it's scary at the same time. I never really have, you know, but, yes, very happy. Do you know that you are some of your best qualities? B I don't know. I suppose that I myself know, as, you know, I could, you know, just myself and that's it, you know, just. I can't really, you know, say that I have a specific thing, I suppose. I mean, it depends on the person who meets me to tell me. I can't really say to myself, like, oh, I'm that, I'm that. You know, just try to be my best and try to portray something good so that others, you know, tell me or, you know, compliment me or so. Yeah. What are the things you want to change about you? B nothing. I think, as I said, I am satisfied with the person I am right now and, you know, my faults or anything, you know, I could have. I don't know, whatever the faults that people see in me, and it's okay, you know, I agree with that, no matter. It's fair. I'm not going. I cannot change myself for the tastes of others. I have only one body and a life. So, yes, yes, that's all. Just my childhood with my sisters and my family. But, you know, it's. You know, you learn. You learn from the past and you have a little feeling, hey, you know, maybe I should be a better model, you know, for my children and therefore my children could be better models, so that the world can improve. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B just smile and be happy, you know, and whatever the difficult things, you know, you will finally cross them. You know, the only thing you can't. I don't know, you can't, you know, going back is death. You know, you might know, sorrow or something else. But, you know, as long as I am alive, I always have to continue. Yeah. What are you most proud of in your life? B I don't know. It's pretty, huh? The most proud, I guess I do my best to be the best possible. And it's pretty proud, you know, me. You know, it would probably be something that I could be super proud, you know, as much as I can. Very hard. I'm not going to lie. It's really difficult, you know, because I can't say, you know, it's easy to be bad, but it's difficult to be good, you know, and, you know, it's always challenges and everything that is happening, you know, in your life. But, you know, that's right. It is. It is sometimes, you know, hard, you know, and sometimes it comes easy, you know, after a while, you get a lot of practice and everything is like, you have a good day. You haven't even tried, you know. SO. Yeah, you know, loving, friendly, outgoing, you know, adventurous. I guess. I don't know, that's what they say. Just you know, it's them like, you know. But what is. At least what I am trying to be, you know, at least I try to give the best forefoot always as much as possible, you know, even sometimes, even if I have a difficult day, I am just as, oh, you know. You know, I'm just. I don't want to withdraw anyone or anything, you know. Yeah, yeah. To tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B My ideal weekend? Usually, I like to go to the park. I like to sit like a tree. Under a tree actually under a tree where there is shade and simply like putting my blanket there, having my dog ​​and reading a book and you know, sometimes if I do not do T to my dog, as if there were small squirrels flowing and they like me to feed them. So it's quite neat, you know, just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the noise, I suppose. Because there is no silence, you know, the wind and the cars and you know, it's right. It's really good. A it's so good to hear. B yeah. R I think I asked for everything I need. B awesome. THANKS. You are welcome.

"Well, so now I'm going to start virtual humans. She will chat with you a little, then when she is finished, she will make you know and I will give you the door to let me know. All right. Here is the doorbell. B ok. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yeah. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. How are you doing? A it's good. I'm great, thank you. Where do you come from? B I am from, like, a suburb of the, of the San Gabriel Valley. A really? What are the things you really like? B I like diversity. I like the city's atmosphere. I have experienced other places and just not as happy here. I feel like I can really prosper here. So, I just like it, like all the things that are so close to each other and there are a lot of interesting things. These are completely different parts of the city, a few kilometers from each other. What are the things you don't really like at it? B I don't like traffic, I don't like all the cars. But I can live with it. I mean, there is not much that I don't like. A good. What have you studied at school? B I studied music, vocal performance. I studied music, technology, things like that. A great. Do you still work in there? B yes. What are you doing now? B For the moment, I sing in an opera company, but I have a day work because it does not pay much unless you really work for the Opera. So I have day work. I work in a call center which is mainly aimed at artists and actors and things like that. And it's really good because if I receive a call, I can call and change my quarter work very easily. So it's actually a very good concert. And I sometimes do technology concerts. You know, do recordings, things of sound live, but I want to keep them away. Sometimes do video work. But again, I want to get away from that. I want to go back to. Because I find that playing more is more interesting. I like to be more talent than I like to be the crew. So I want to go away on this side and start working more to do what I want to do with my life. A good. Do you consider yourself introverted? B sometimes. I mean, for my personal life, yes. So I have a shell that I put there to face people, but if I am at home, you know, I simply prefer to stay for me or my husband or my cats or something else, talk to the family. I don't really have too many close friends, but, yes, you know, I prefer to stay for myself. How far are you from your family? B moderately close to the family I am left. I have actually lost a lot of family in the past 10 years. But, like. THANKS. But as, my close to my husband and, you know, I have some cousins ​​to whom I speak and my aunt that I have an aunt to which I speak a little. But it's not like we interact every day, but it's a bit close. A good. What do you do to relax? B especially I sing or I read or I write or I hang out and I try to empty my mind of all the thoughts. Sometimes it doesn't work, but I try to do this and try to erase everything and see what is starting to come back. And sometimes it works, sometimes this is not the case. But mainly creating things, by contacting my family. So you know, via Facebook or everything that works. But especially during my free time, I create things. A good. Do you travel a lot? B I would like to travel more. I really like to travel by car. My idea, like having a birthday celebration would be to make a road trip, and I like to travel more. I would love to travel for work things or something else, but I don't get as many opportunities I would like to travel. What do you have to travel. B in particular while traveling by car? See, as, the landscape changes, see people change, see, you know, feel the vibrations of the region change. I just like to see what exists. And I know there is a larger world outside the place where I am and where I live and my world. I like to see that, but I also like to leave it and go back to my own world. A trip I like is to make the reader here in Nevada. Whether I'm going to Vegas or I'm just going. At the state line, my cousin and I took what we call outing trips 1. Because once you arrive at the first outing of a highway, you are either in another state or you are at the end of the highway. We therefore take them. We are just impromptu with day or two notice, just move things, take off. So these are trips that I like to make because I take off and I come back. Sometimes the same day, sometimes overnight. Just short short trips that are not very involved, but you can just go and you see things and see how the desert The landscape resembles different seasons, how people react to different periods of the year in different fields. So close to you, but not near you. Near my home, but still in a world because I don't really have time to take two weeks of vacation or something else. But these are just little things that put things back into perspective and live my head and things like that. Because there is sort of a feeling of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you do not drive a highway. So I like to do that. R when is the last time that happened? B The last time it happened, it was May of last year. So, the last time, I was able to do it. Actually. My aunt came with my cousin who is 10 years younger than me, and we grew up like sisters. And I was about to move away from the inner empire, where they live, so they somehow took me last Hourra and we led to Vegas and I looked around and returned because I lived in Vegas for a while, but I did not like. So they. I showed them some of the local sites there and we came back and we were, you know, a night trip, but we were driving all the time. It is rather interesting. Things that are simply unfair. When people are mean for the elderly or for children or for animals or people who cannot fight back, they are nasty for them simply because they cannot fight back. And I really like to see people as strong as people who are nasty standing and a defender or what you have. So I think it's something that makes you really crazy. Being just cruel or nasty for no reason. You know, not for people who cannot fight back or for people who have done nothing to deserve it. This kind of really drives me crazy. A good, what are you doing when you are annoyed? B When I am annoyed, I will try to get away from the situation. And if the situation is just following me, then I will end up wrapping in one way or another, you know, by cutting them verbally with a joke or, you know, I mean, rarely just, I will rarely cry about someone, but I will try to get angry and get away from me. It usually works. Not like legal troubles or anything because generally I will find a way to make them leave myself alone. There is not really big troubles, but I think because it is disabled and it is not the expected reaction and it is actually a little cultivated In me, this is not the expected reaction because I know it will work and distance people from me. It is therefore not really in difficulty. And if it is a problem, it is generally trouble that it is from the point of view of the other and it does not affect me at all because in due course, I can go out. When they leave me alone, I will get away from it. A good. When will you go back the last time you argued with someone? B the last time I discussed with someone like a per. Like a family member or a foreigner or someone who is not in mine. The last thing I could think was to argue with my husband about my mother-in-law because she has dementia. And so us. One of the reasons why we got out of the inner empire here was to take care of it because it will only go. I mean she is like Hardcore Angeleno. We know that we are in our nature, but we also know that it is cheaper to live elsewhere. So we came here to take care of her and he wants her to stay in her apartment and I want her to move with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier for her if she lived with us. But she wants to stay where she is because she cannot see that there is now an inherent danger because of the pathological process. But he wants her to stay where she is. He wants her to have what she wants. Because he is a boy from a mom like me. I am a daughter of a mom. Even if I lost my mother four years ago, I am still a daughter of mom and I always go. And I'm still, you know, I know it brings you a feeling of satisfaction to achieve their wishes because you care so much about them. That's what they want. So you want to get it for them. And because it happened when you grow up, when they tried to give you what you want because you want it and want to do this for them now, as somehow restore someone to your heart, someone you feel merit. But it's a bit dangerous for her and I don't want something to happen to her yet. I want her to remain that she is as long as she can. Because I know that an illness she has erased who she is ultimately. And finally, she will have to be placed in a place where they can give her medically trained 24 hours. But until then, we can manage it with us. It is not so bad, but it is where she really has no life to live alone. So the solution right now is that there are most of the time there with it and I go back to us and it obtains st Shake and it becomes boring because I do it, I manage external things, I do the shopping, I take it to the store, things like that. He does things daily, make sure she eats, make sure she, you know, has clean clothes, things like that. So I mean that it is a partnership, it's a, it's a double effort. It's really a double effort. But I would like her to move with us. It was therefore, it's like a source of. It's not really like shouting, screaming, but a lively discussion, you know and debate. It is not insurmountable. I mean, life will never be easy. You know, if this is the case, this is when you have to worry because that is when someone can remove the carpet under you. So as long as you know things and you are present in your life, it will not be easy. But you face it and you move on. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B The most positive influence that I think I was probably my mother and grandmother because my mother was roughly a single mother and my grandmother helped me to raise and they made me a lot of confidence but were realistic on this subject. So I mean, I think I have a kind of realistic temperament and in a way for myself. But they help me see that it is just in me and it is not something that I cannot overcome and that, you know, life will continue. You know, my mother would tell me, when you are 40 years old, you are 40 years old, that you work at McDonald's or that you do what you want in your life. I think it was a great influence on how, how I lived my life since she died. A it's great. Is there anything you regret? B I regret not taking care of myself during the last year of my mother's life because I think it may have darkened some of my decisions. Now I have underlying conditions, and everyone in my family is diabetic. And I did not take care of that when she was the last year of her life because I was too busy wanting to bring her home. My goal was to bring her home. So I didn't eat well, I didn't take my insulin correctly. I ended up making myself resistant to insulin. That year because my blood sugar was so high for about a year, just eating horrible food when I ate. So it really wreaked havoc. And I really made myself very sick. And I wonder, well, if I did not do it, if I had taken care of myself and I had my head completely straight, my vision and my thoughts were not darkened, I would have made better decisions in her name, especially when she needed it and When she needed me to intervene and make decisions. Because she ended up having a health disaster because she had a kidney. She has undergone kidney damage. He ended up being renal failure and his health insurance provider missed this. So she ended up having a kind of all this catastrophe where everything immediately started to break. She ended up having a stroke at 51. She had a little blow, and it was just got down from there. So I think, well, if I didn't do it, if I had taken care of myself better, could I have taken care of her better? And I know that there was nothing that I could have done to prevent his death, but could I have made it easier for him if I had taken care of myself? It is, like, a huge regret that I have. R do you think you may be a little hard with yourself? B oh, I know I am. But it is my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that is close to my heart. Take responsibility for my own life and me and mine. And I know other people, I can't really direct them in my own vision because they are their own beings and they can't, you know, what I want them to be. And I know it will not be, but I always know, my ideals and I want the way I want everything to happen, and I want everyone that I want to be happy and to be able to integrate my life in a way, in the best possible way. But I know because they are other beings and I will not be able to do it for them, so I can do that for me. But it is always by ideals. So I sometimes have to look at it and go there, well, is that what I want? Because I want it. Or what do they want? And is it their decision or mine? And she is. It's theirs. I know it's theirs. So, if you really care about someone, you will simply support them and accompany them. But it's always a little difficult for me, and I know I have to get back. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B 10 or 20 years ago, to have probably been more assertive in the start of my own life because I ended up taking care of my mother. I mean, she literally fell ill on weekends, I got my university diploma, and I had an aligned work, and I had to withdraw because she needed me to take care of her. I think I would have been more aggressive to start my own life, to get a job outside the house in addition to taking care of it, to obtain my own job history, my own credit history. Things like that have built Instead of completely becoming her daughter for about 10 years. So I think I would probably have done that, but I said to myself, do it and keep who you are and learn to separate who you are and what you think you need to do for your family. To keep an idea of ​​you. This is probably what I would have. And do things for yourself, to keep this sense of you. This is probably the council which I would give myself 10 years ago. A good. Have you ever served in the army? B no. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B No, but probably because I did not go to a doctor about it, because I don't want to know. I mean, this is not the case. I know that there were times in my life when I was seriously depressed, and it is generally circumstances and I had to get out of it, but I prefer to get out before using treatment. Can you see an example? After my mother's death, I mean, it was this long battle for a year that we lost, and I did not know if I was to blame for that. It's like, logically, I knew that I was not, but how could I convince myself? Two weeks after his death, I ended up with pulmonary embolism, one in each lung, because I did not take care of myself for a year. I thought, well, I am 30 years old, yes, you know, whatever I do, I can't do without it, no. But I ended up having to take more medication because of this. It was a fight to recover my own health, to be able to get out of this depression because a large part of my life was based on being my mother's daughter. All of a sudden, I did not do it. It is as if the carpet had been removed. My, like the bottom, fell from my world after that. It was therefore the Prindriy almost sent me to a deep depression. I almost divorced because of this because I didn't want anything anymore. SO. And I was really far from my husband at that time at that. We got married for about two years at that time, and I started to move away from him. Just by rejecting everything, just, you know, to determine what I'm going to do with the rest of my life now. And it was a fight. There are times when, no, I couldn't get up, just stay in bed and sleep all day. But then realizing that when my mother died, I had four casts to take care. Two were mine, two were hers. So I ended up adopting the two who were hers. Well, they don't have the choice to know if they can go out and get their own food and Ge t their own supplies. I took responsibility to do it for them. It was therefore a motivation factor, it was that they had no choice of knowing whether or not I was going to get up and support them. I mean, I could go without eating. I could go without taking care of myself, but they couldn't. They didn't do it, you know, so they actually raised me and made me go out and face things, even if I didn't want to want to curl up and die. But it would have been my choice, not theirs. And they. I mean, what would it happen to them if I was not there to take care of them? They would have been, you know, sent to a refuge or something else, probably. And maybe they would not have been read at home and adopted by someone else. Maybe they would have been killed. In my opinion. I mean, for me, I make selfish decisions. So it's like I needed someone to take care of getting out of bed. And it was a motivation factor, it is to take. I understood that if it was just me, I could live without many things. I mean, I could live in my car if I wanted to. It wouldn't be a big problem. I would don't care as much as I did what I wanted in my life. But I have a family to take care now, so I have to go out and do things, you know, I have to go out and look for a legitimate work, you know, day work. I have to do it, you know. But I try to find a balance between the two because there is what I want to do with my life, but yet I have to take care of my family. So I work on a balance of both. How difficult? B very. But it's worth it. I mean, it would be very. I would have much less to fear if I lived in my car and said: forget it. But keeping a declining residence, paying bills, things like that is difficult, but you have to do it. If you ever want something in your life, you have to go through it. And I know it. But it gets hard. Sometimes you want to give up. But then is it like, well, what is the alternative? I mean, I don't think I could live a comfortable life because if I did, I wouldn't do anything. I must be a little uncomfortable or I will not do anything with myself. I'm just going to be satisfied, spending time all day, staying in bed, spending time with my cats or something else, and I wouldn't do anything. A I see. How do you feel recently? B very anxious and nervous and I mean, and if I do not find it enough, you know, enough work to be able to pay my rent or something else? And if, you know, and if I can't Keep a semblance of stability in my life? And it is actually a difficult job to be stable and I know that it is a difficult job to be stable, but what, you know, that's just what is a lot of things and these are things that have not happened. And it's stupid and unnecessary to worry about things that have not happened. And I know, but he has always done so. This is always part. It is therefore a source of anxiety when they try to let anxiety go by advancing things, understanding things, doing a solid plan and going there. But I know it's a cycle and I'm going to be really anxious and, Oh my God, what am I going to do? What am I going to do to say, okay, what is the fundamental thing that I need to take care of here? I mean, what is just narrow and what are the real non-problublicms and what is the real problem? So discover things that way. And then anxiety begins to disappear a little. But then something will appear and the sions will come back. I will have to understand it again. But I know it's a cycle. I know. And what seems enormous on the surface, when you start to eliminate it, you overcome it fairly quickly. You cross it. A yes. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? B The last time I felt really happy. I don't know. Like, huh. This is a good question that surprisingly perplexed me because I sometimes feel happy. Sometimes not so much. Sometimes just a little in the middle. Really, like a happyly happy. I don't know. I can't think when it happened. A good. How would your best friend describe you? B I don't know. You don't know? Perceptions of others. I mean, probably as a person who, curiously, someone who is relaxed and, you know, manages things as you go, but I don't see myself at all like that. What would you say that some of your best qualities are? Probably I can think standing and I'm not afraid to shake up my buttocks and do everything I have to survive and get things done. And I can do it in a creative way. And I try to seek balance. Probably the best things about me. A it's great. What are you most proud of in your life? B that I do essentially what I want in my life, which is even if it is not easy, this is not the case. I am not financially easy or anything, it is even more than many people to say about their lives. Because I have an aunt I really don't talk about. And the reason why I am not talking to her is that she is always miserable. I mean, she has a career than she. It's no longer a job that She fell because my older aunt loves animals but did not want to be a veterinarian. So she became a dog toiletress. And she was really very good in this area. She had a stable business for a long time, but she knows, she started to have arthritis in her hands and she had done so. In fact, my cousin's father went and somehow stole all the money from his business. So she lost her business and she. She retired early because between this and arthritis, she ended up retiring early. She used my youngest aunt, who is always a dog groomer, but she hates that. And it's like changing your life. If you hate your life so much, change it. And the thing I am most proud of is, yes, I am not as well as financial as it is, but I do what I want in my life. You know, I can be creative. I can have creative people around me, people who I really like to talk about around me, people I love in my life and be happy. And I see a lot of people who are not. And that gives me a feeling perhaps a feeling of swollen self-satisfaction to be able to say that I am not like that, that I really do what I want. Even if there are sacrifices, I always do fundamentally what I want in my life now. A it's so good to hear. B Thank you. R I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. B Thank you.

And she just raised her finger and gave me her finger. And it was right. It's funny, sometimes you try to approach someone in a normal and loving way and all they have for you is hatred.

"A good, so now I'm going to put the door from the door here. B Very well? R When you are finished, just press this button. B Okay, thank you. THANKS. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. Feel a little tired and worried. One why? B well, I'm looking for a place to live and I don't have a job at the moment, so things are a little trembling for me. R I'm sorry to hear that. It can be difficult to find a good job these days. Where do you live? Where do you live? B I stay with my son in Venice. How do you like your life situation? B It's pretty good, but we both need to have our own space, that's why I am looking for another place to live. R I understand. Where do you come from? B from New York, but I have been in California since the early 1970s. A it's long. B yeah. Why did you move to the? B I moved to Los Angeles because I lived in Portland, Oregon, and I got tired of time up there and my son was here, so it seemed to be a good place. How is you easy to get used to living in Los Angeles? B It was not too hard. I met people right away and I really like it here, so it was easy to connect with people. A it's good. What are the things you really like? B Time is number one for most people. I love being near the ocean. I like energy, I like artistic culture. What are the things you don't really like at it? B well, everyone loves traffic. I mean, like the weather and hates traffic. So I feel sort of. I feel the same. Sometimes it gets a little. Bringing that it is so busy and the fact that it is so expensive makes it difficult. R I see what you mean. I am sure you can say by my shoes that I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B No, not as much as I wish. If I had more income, more funds, I would travel more. To I would love to hear about one of your trips. B Well, especially I was it. I have traveled. Let's see. So my longest trip that was outside the country was in Mexico. And I traveled, I went down with a friend in Oaxaca, and all the trip we made. I think we took about four weeks of own and return from the bay region. It was a fun trip. How did you decided to do this? B Well, we worked together on the census, and she had made this trip a few times and invited me to accompany her. What is one of your most memorable experiences. B of this trip? I would say that we were in Oaxaca for the day of the dead. It was therefore the day of the Day of the Dead with the family of the small village in which we seduced. Everyone in the village makes an altar in their house for their deceased loved ones. And they also decorate. Clean and decorate the graves. So there were a lot of flowers. And it was right. It was good to be there and to be with this family celebrating this. A great. What have you studied at school? Well, I was in the Liberal arts program, but I only stayed at school in college for a few years, but I was most interested in liberal arts and human sciences. What is your dream work? B My dream work would be personal. Help someone who was in a creative field and who went to travel and go to events with him. How difficult? B It is difficult to penetrate. I am now starting very at least, with someone with whom I do more volunteer work, and I work to develop some of my skills so that I can do more. A it's good. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I am fairly. I am a kind of friendly introvert, so you know, I have no trouble meeting people. I don't hold back and, you know, just. I am not, shy during the holidays. I will go up and talk to people, but I am generally introverted, so I prefer one on one that large groups. A good. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I like to look. Well, I like to watch improvement emissions like HGTV. I like to watch, like, renovate shows and see transformations or watch movies or read. And I play the solitary on my Kindle fire. A good. How are you going to control your temperament? B I generally do not realize that I am angry that later, so it does not really come. And I tend not to have the kind of life where these situations occur. Sometimes. You know, sometimes on the road, I am a little bored, I am not so bored, like when people cut me off or something like that, but when people are deliberately coarse and horror without reason, or when they get angry because maybe I did something introducing, cut them by mistake, and They really get angry, then it puts me back in return. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone, and what was it? B HMM. Yeah. As I said, I never tire of it in the arguments. I was with one friend the other day, and she got bored with me because she felt like she is correcting her, so it was not really an argument. But she. You know, I said something she had heard as a correction. Well, it was a correction, and she got angry. How did you feel at that time? B Well, so I felt criticized, and I felt. I felt vulnerable. I was not. It was. It was quite uncomfortable. To tell me about a situation you want you to manage differently. B um, well, me in this situation, I did not have to correct it. So I think it's something I start to look at myself, it's my need to be right. So, in general, I try to catch this and let people make mistakes without my telling them. A MM. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to make. B HMM. Hmm. Boy, I don't know. Gee, it's difficult. I cannot know that I had so much trouble making decisions. Well, it was difficult for me to decide to put my cat to sleep when he was sick, and I had to abandon a cat, and I moved once, and it was difficult too. R I'm sorry to hear that. How did you decided to do this? B Well, in the case of the first cat, the one who was sick, I decided when the veterinarian said he thought it was the human decision. And with the cat, I had to give up. I haven't really decided. I was moving in a place where I could not take it, so I found someone who could take it. To Tell Me on an event or something you want to be able to erase from your memory. B See, it's difficult. So I don't really do it. The erasure of the memory part. There is nothing that I really want to be able to erase from my memory. Try to think of something I did that I want I did not do. Oh okay. I remember something. There was a time when I was. I was in a class at the Junior College. It was a film class, and I was the one. After our release and made a small film project and that we were supposed to bring him back to class next week. I was the one who had the film and through different things, just things that were going on in my life right now. I have never returned to school, but I never brought them the film. So all the work they had done, they had to redo. And I always feel bad about it. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B it's quite easy. Something Etimes, I wake up early in the morning and I find it difficult to go back to sleep, but it is not very often. How have you been feeling lately? B I felt a little tired and depressed at low level, like not feeling many options. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B yes, I have. How long have you been diagnosed? B well, there were twice. There was once back in 1972. Around 1972 or three, then another time. Oh, then when would it have been? About 16 years ago. What made you ask for help? B just feeling that there was not, you know, the feeling that things were not going to change if I had no help and that if I did not have to do it, you know, maybe if I had medication, it would help me in the short term. Are you going to always in therapy now? B I'm not going to therapy for the moment. Why did you stop? B I was moving a lot. Finances. I didn't really feel the need. Starting to think that it could be an option again. Do you have the impression that therapy is useful? B I have the impression that therapy can be useful, yes. What kind of changes have you noticed since you go to therapy? Well, when I went to therapy, it was useful to have someone who listened to and could also offer impartial suggestions to help me improve what I felt. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B well, I was on the beach last weekend. It was a beautiful day and I was sitting in the sun and I relaxed. I had my notebook and I made writings and I felt very happy and contained. R that looks like an excellent situation. What would you say that some of your best qualities are? B I am kind and compassionate and I am a good listener and I am intelligent and I have good ideas. What are the things you want to change about you? B well, I want that sometimes I would have liked to be a harder worker. I am not really willing to take low salary jobs even if I need work. So I just don't have the impression of being ready to do anything. And I would like to be able to act. I said I had good ideas, I have good ideas and I am good at first, but I'm not really good at follow -up. So many of these ideas start, but I don't draw them from the distance. This is probably the thing that I would like to change the most about myself. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B 10 or 20 years ago, I will give myself the advice to return to school and get my diploma, finish my studies and be ready to do k regular use and start to store money for my retirement. What are you most proud of in your life? B proud of my children and I am proud of the friendships I have. And I'm proud that people. People admire me and appreciate my opinion. A it's great. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. B Goodbye. All right. All right.

B ignorant, for lack of a better word. R could you have done something to avoid it? B Now that I think about it, I could have done a lot to avoid it, but. But I was just young and stupid. One yeah. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to make. B to start love again. A good. Tell me about an event or something you want you to erase from your memory. Hobo. As much pain as I saw it in the world. Can you tell me? Hobo. A compilation of all the events, just different bad things I saw. For example, if I could change it, I would. But sometimes I guess things are there for a reason, even if we don't understand it. R I see what you mean. What do you feel guilty? B I have no answer to that. A good. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B Blood. Family. Really? Do not speak. My wife. I don't know if she really wants to be there with me or not. She thinks I do everything in the world, but that I am not. And really, I don't understand. I know that my daughter loves me, but I don't know if she wants to be with me or not. One why? B because when someone speaks to you, when he says something a certain time, and the tone is in a voice and a belief in their eyes. If you say something many times, which really lies in your heart so that you can say anything through your mouth, but that's what is really there. A I see. Tell me about your children. B I like my daughter. He's an angel. I cut his umbilical cord. I went up there and put his first shirt. I saw her go out. She looked at me right away by the stomach. She was fighting with the doctors, would not let them touch her a little. I told him. I told her to calm down. I told him it was dad. She looked up, grabbed my fingers and. And, like, calm down and let them do everything they needed. R Do you find easy to be a parent? B no. He constantly changes tasks. What you have to do today will not be the same as the next or the next after that. It's constantly. What is a better word for that? Adjustment. What is the most difficult thing to be a parent? B The most difficult thing, I will probably say, is to scold your child because you know that you do it out of love for not having learned the bad lessons. What is the best thing to be a parent? B See your baby smile and appreciation. What are the ways that you are different as a parent than your parents? B I'm trying to keep my baby much more of the things she sees. Can you give me an example? B When I was younger, there were a lot of things I saw that no child or adult should have seen. And when I grew up, I swore that I will always take care of my child and that I do not disappear or would not let him be in things like that. A good. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B UM, our nourishing parents. Can you tell me? B mmm. They have mainly shown me, no matter where you come from, you can always try to improve. A good. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B a good night's sleep? It comes the same thing. Just tired of Yarning. How have you been feeling lately? B How did I feel? As if I had a richness of requests and a richness of gold at my reach, and it's just out of my reach because I just need this connector to really see what I am capable of. And I know I am capable of a lot. It's fair. I need to make this connection. R Have you noticed these latest changes in your behavior or your thoughts? B no. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B not the SSPT, no. Are you diagnosed with depression? B said yes. But I don't think I'm more depressed or anything other people. Everyone has their different break points. A good. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B my daughter's birthday on the 26th. Did you tell me? B took him or T to Chuck E. Cheese. She had fun. She played games. She was on bikes. She was railing through puzzle games. Man. Roll. Done about everything. R that looks like an excellent situation. How would your best friend describe you? B fun, loyal, attentive. What are the things you want to change about you? B something to change. I would like to be more precise. A good. Is there anything you regret? B not knowing who my mother was. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Stop thinking about everything that has happened and just do what you need to do. Do you know that you are some of your best qualities? B I am positive. I am focused on the objectives, determined. I am very imaginative, very creative. To tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B ideal? I probably do a little of everything. Climbing, cycling, hiking, part with my daughter. Places, guy. I'm probably going to ski, snowboarding and everything in an ideal weekend. What are you most proud of in your life? B my daughter. A good. I think I asked for everything I need.

B I'm doing really well. A it's good. Where do you come from? B I come from Granada Hills, California. This is the part of the San Fernando valley in Los Angeles. What are the things you really like at? B I like time. I like the diversity of people. I like the way you can go to a neighborhood and it's not just a breed or a kind of food. I love the beaches, all the activities you could go do with themed parks, aquariums, things like that. Museums. What are the things you don't really like at it? B smog. There are a lot of frightening guys. R I see what you mean. I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B I traveled roughly.

We had an apartment there. He snowed a lot. We have sold antiquities to live. A great. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B Get passes, press passes for the Sunset Strip Music Festival by a friend. And meet rock stars and spend time at private holidays. R that looks like an excellent situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I'm very out of the way. I love people. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it is. This is the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I'm going to the gymnasium and I train a little. I find that it helps relieve stress and maintain my energy level. I notice if I do not train a few days, I feel a little more tired than normal and it just helps me feel good. How are you going to control your temperament? B I'm quite good in this area. I am very quiet. I have worked a lot of events and jobs you are dealing with, like thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to and you have to stay calm and, you know, they are the customer, so you have to make them feel sought and good and realize that you are paid because the money they spend. So I am good to resolve, like consumption conflicts and work at work. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone? B I had a drunk friend who was just falling and shouted and said gross things to people. And I have somehow started to become noisy, like, just tell her to stop doing this and that she was embarrassing and what she said to people was very nasty, you know, and I wonder, as if you are talking to people like that, they might not love her and they could attack you or something, you know, you never know. It's there. Yeah, it sucks. What do you feel guilty? B I don't really feel guilty of anything. Decisions that I made in my life. I think I made very good decisions, and I always stick to my moral compass, which I do. I grew up in church, so I haven't been for years, but I still have these values ​​and, you know, the rules, the ten commandments and the stuff in my head. To tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B I had a Slumlord owner, and I wish I have called, you know, the appropriate authorities and that I followed a legal affair instead of leaving it, as, in a way, I did not intimate myself because it was not up to the code. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have. One must have already done. B a few years ago, I went out with a guy and he wanted me to go back where he came from. And after a few months, you know, he came to Los Angeles and returned home. I decided to move there. And I had just started, you know, this company I was doing, the event planning was resuming, and I decided to leave there and try to do it there on the East Coast. And it didn't work. But it was difficult to decide, if I leave it and make this jump and try something new and experience something new or stay in what I was doing. What did you study at school? B I had a diploma in dental assistance. I did it for a year. I didn't like it. And then I studied communications, such as radio and television and journalism. Do you still work in there? B Somew hat. I do event work and I wrote for a magazine for a few years and I try to like a website and I have where I control my own writing and what is happening instead of, you know, writing for someone else. I always wanted to ride and I was always in the news, music and art. Growing up, I really liked Connie Chung. She was like a Channel 4 press log in the 80s. And I loved Barbara Walters. A it's great. B I was a nerd. No. Tell me on your relationship with your family. B my sister, she does not speak to any family. And I have a good relationship with my mother. I have never really known my father. I don't mind. I have cousins ​​and stuff, but everyone is dispersed across the country, so I don't really talk to them on the phone. We simply communicate on Facebook or as Twitter. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B oh, I'm going to the right to sleep. When I am tired, I fall asleep. How have you been feeling lately? B pretty well. Energetic. I have been motivated to get more event work, you know, event planning stuff and grind it more than me. How difficult? B I mean it's a bit difficult because you have to talk to people and make them trust and see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B I mean, I am generally quite happy unless something devastating happens as someone has cancer or someone I know dies. I wouldn't say that. I'm just great like, Oh my God, happy all the time. But it's like a uniform keel that I feel pretty good all the time. Do you know that you are some of your best qualities? B I am very talkative and friendly and I could approach foreigners and speak to them comfortable. And I could adapt to different situations. And even if it is not my scene or a situation or a group of people I am used to, I could always jump, talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adapt. At uh huh. What are the things you want to change about you? B I want to earn more money. A me too. Talk to me about an era when someone made you feel really hurt about you. B I remember in the second year, these people made fun of me because I was very tall and skinny and I had as a rights, one of the highest notes in the class. So wo people I don't care about myself and call me giraffe or stuff like that. How would your best friend describe you? B very talkative. She just said that I am talking to everyone and that I am very friendly and if you need help, that I will help someone you know. To Tell Me on something you recently did that you really enjoyed. B oh, recently, I went to Oceanside and I visited a friend whom I know years and we just went out for burgers and dragged on the beach and we had his two -year -old son and as we took him to the park and played and it was really nice and it was cool to visit him. I hadn't seen it for six months and it was really fun and I want to go back and I like the region. R which you feel guilty? B I guess I might try to find my own job more as for my business instead of working for other people. I think I pursue it, but I think I might devote a little more time, a day. R I see what you mean. Tell me about an event or something you want you to erase from your memory. B I really know nothing as we want to erase or not to happen. A good. Is there anything you regret? B no. I feel good in my choices that I made and I think I am on the right track. And a lot of things I wanted to do, the ball rolls and I am, you know, to make things happen. I'm not as tall as I want, but I feel like I am on my way. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Like 10 years ago, I would have said myself to work more during the day instead of going out as much as I do. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B My friend we call Mojo. Can you tell me? B Mojo has a magazine and I just wrote years and he really pushes me to like to continue writing and continuing to make events and continuing the ball. I ride. And he is one of the biggest people, you know, in my life. Tell me that you are talented, you could do it. You know, it's just a very good motivation for me. A it's great. What are you most proud of in your life? B You know, being published. I went to television shows and I just do my own event and I have a lot of people who read what I write every day and that I am. And I just think it's one. You know, it's not exactly Hunter where I want to be, but it's an excellent start. And I worked to get to this point. One yeah. All right.

I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please, please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Um, pretty good. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B As far as my parents. Ethiopia. A Really? B Yes. A What are some things you really like about la? B The beaches, the warm weather, the diverse environment. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B Traffic. A Yeah, I see what you mean. What do you study at school? B Well, I'm currently in school. I'm studying African Studies. A Cool. How did you decide to do that? B I've always been interested in African studies. Actually, I've always wanted to help people, and I figured that I could help them by trying to learn about it and going back to Africa and making influence. A That's great. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Kind of in between. I have my shy moments, but then when I'm around a group of people that I enjoy, I'm pretty outgoing. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B To relax? I normally write. Or I go to the beach and just sit there, play my guitar. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Pretty good. I don't really get angry or anything like that. I tend to keep it in or try to release it by writing. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B I actually can't remember the last time I argued with someone. A Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Mmm. B All the people I've hurt in the past. A Can you tell me about that? B Well, I've, like, cheated on people, hurt their feelings, intentionally. Done things I shouldn't have done that I regret. A Now, tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. B Um. Well, with my ex, I could have ended it better so we could be on Better terms now. I probably shouldn't have argued so much or tried to instigate so many things. I probably should have just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Um, the hardest decision I've ever had to make was. Man, I really don't know, actually. A Okay, tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Um, having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer. A Tell me about that. B Well, he had a tumor that he had to get removed, so it was just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really didn't want to be there because he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that. But just seeing him stuck in bed was just terrible. A Yeah, that sounds really hard. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B Me and my family aren't very close. We don't. I mean, they've always been there for me, and I appreciate it, but we've never had that close connection, especially since they're foreign. So they don't really understand where I'm trying to come from, having been grown up out in America. So it's pretty different when it comes to racial. I mean, the cultural boundaries that we kind of step each over each other's feet on. But aside from that, we have a decent relationship. When we do speak to each other, it does get kind of awkward, but it's okay. A What do you think of today's kids? B I think they are out of control. I think that they're learning things that they shouldn't know at this age. I think that they're doing things they shouldn't be doing. And I don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it. I feel like they're being applauded by the media. They're being applauded by celebrities that they follow, and there's not enough being done about it, and they're just getting lost. A Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Depends on the night. Some nights it's pretty hard. Some nights I fall asleep like a baby. A What are you like when you don't sleep? Well. B Usually creative. Actually, when I can't sleep, I'll just stay up and I'll write something or I'll read a book and ideas will pop up. Stuff like that is usually a good thing. When I can't sleep it's nothing really bad because I'm having bad thoughts or anything like that. A Okay. How have you been feeling lately? B Lately? Between a mix of good and bad, I have my happy moments where I'm energized and I'm live. Then some days where I'm just, you know, just sitting there, just mellow thinking, not like my live self. A Why? B I don't know. It's just always been like that. Always have those ups and those downs, but they kind of balance each other out. A Mm. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Um, the last time I felt really happy was. Hmm. Today. A Tell me more about that. B Just from the moment I woke up, it was a beautiful sunny day. I went to see some friends. We had a good time, went to school, had some good grades on some papers, wrote a good essay, feel pretty accomplished. And I feel like my day is just a good day. A That's so good to hear. How would your best friend describe. B My best friend would describe me as odd. Most people would describe me as odd. A Why? B I say a lot of odd things. I do odd things. I'm interested in things that most people aren't. A Like what? B Just like old literature, revolutionary stuff. Stuff about changing the world, but through underground means. A Cool. Is there anything you regret? B Um. No, I. I don't live a life of regret. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B To never let fear stop you from doing anything. A Uh huh. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B Um, reading. Just hanging out with some friends, driving around, finding something to do. Just go on an adventure. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B I don't wish I could change anything about myself. I just wish I could build myself into the person that I'm truly supposed to be. A Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. B This one time, me and my best friend got into an argument and she pointed out all the things I've done that I shouldn't have done all at one time. How I've hurt people, how I've hurt her. The ways I've done them. That were brutal. And it just made me feel bad once I reflected on it all. A Yeah. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B My parents. A Can you tell me about that? B I mean, although we don't see eye to eye, they always bring me to this realization that I need at the end of the day. Although I never listen to them or I don't choose to listen to them. Once it happens, I learn from it and I'm like, oh, that's what my parents told me. So I learned to trust them more and I learned to understand that they are wiser than me and that they do know more than me. A I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B Not so much anymore. I travel around la, try to find new sights to see. But as far as I don't travel outside. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Discovering new things. Discovering things you never knew were there or the limitless possibilities? I enjoy discovering new people, new cultures, new things that go against what's normal for us and for myself. A When was the last time that happened? B A few days ago. I just drove out to the middle of the desert and I just sat there and I just enjoyed all that the desert had to offer. And it was just enjoyable. A Nice. How did you feel in that moment? B I felt free, away from all these cities and these buildings, and it just felt nice to be out in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time. Felt good. A What are you most proud of in your life? B I'm most proud that I've always been different. That despite how many people have told me that I'm really weird or I'm odd or I think weird things, I've always maintained my original mentality. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to.

"R When she finished, you can go ahead and let me know. All right? B ok. A and it will make you know. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? Hobo. Very good. A little, yes. Where are you from? B los Angeles. A really? B yes. What are the things you really like at? B The thing I love in? Time. What are the things you don't really like at it? B It's not easy to meet people. Can you tell me? B well, you just feel that people haven't come out much. They are like this film in Crash where people are all the time in their cars. It's like that. Yeah, I see what you mean. I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B No, not too much. A good. What have you studied at school? B Child development. How did you decided to do this? B well, I have a son and I wanted to know how to be a good mom. And so I wanted to know the stages he would go through and be able to relate to him better. A it's great. Are you happy that you did that? B I am. Have you always done that? B I'm trying to start again in the fall. A like my work. You could almost say that it is practically made for me. What is your dream work? B I would like to write. A beautiful. Tell me about that. B well, I wrote children's books and I just did research, trying to publish my books. It is only two that I have written so far, but they are pretty good. I obtained good comments on them from my criticism groups. What was it? B He is a little boy who is surrounded by people who are shades and he tries not to become a fool with him. And it's going a bit like really. He goes through a lot of mood dealing with people in his life. A great. Do you find it easy to be a parent? B no. I had problems, nervous starts, in fact. And right now, my son is staying with his father. Even. So no. I was a single mom. It was the most difficult thing, I think, in the world, it is to be a single mother. One yeah. B SO. How do you face them? B How can I face? Well, at the moment I did not have a lot of adaptation skills or Mechanisms was therefore the problem. What is the best thing to be a parent? B It's so spontaneous. Like the things that come out of the mouths of children sometimes and the things they do and make you smile. Can you give me an example? B well, when my son was younger once, we were just sitting around the house and he comes and he starts to style me and he said to me, mom, I want you to put lipstick and high heels and horse tails so that you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend. So, yes, quite spontaneous things like it happens that my children tell me that I no longer need to be single. A good. What is the most difficult thing to be a parent? B The most difficult thing? Not wanting to kiss it. I feel a lot of stress and pressure that each little thing will make a difference and an importance and what kind of person my child turns out to be. And so it's a lot of stress on yourself. Yeah. R do you think you may be a little hard with yourself? B yeah, definitely. What are the ways that you are different as a parent than your parents? B I think I am different from my mother because I am a little more tolerant of this spontaneous interaction. I rejoice you, you know, I am delighted to know who my child is right now and not to try to shape them in someone I want them to be, but to see them become the best possible child, the best adult they can be without molding them in this direction necessarily in a different person. A UHHUH. So who is someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B say it again. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B Who is someone who is a positive influence? One yeah. B I really have no one like that. A good. B ok. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B Well, I tried to meditate sometimes, but I don't really stick to it often enough. I tried to love, to take walks, but I don't always do it and I don't always stick to it. So yes, that's about it. How are you going to control your temperament? B I would say that I am a little below average. Which means I get angry more than most people. I think it was the last time. R You discussed someone and what was it? B HMM. Last night it was on the phone. I was chatting with my husband. We have. My sister lives with us, and she lives with us in a very small room with The small apartment, I should say. And she has four people living in a room. So it's a little stressful. It's really crowded and my husband is stressed about it. And, you know, I just tell him that I told you. I told you that if my sister moved here, then there would be a mess in the house, and that she will ask for things that she does not really want to do. This is how my sister is. So the house is messy and crowded, and every day they ask for rides. And my husband, he avoids getting home because all these people are at home and he doesn't want to be there anymore. And I just say that he will have to find a way to face it because he asked him, in my opinion. SO. Who sucks. B is the case. To tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B oh, I have tons. But right now, what I think is to lose care of my son right now. For example, I have been arguing with my mother-in-law and my half-sister for a long time about my son and how they treat him and how I want him to be treated. For example, they have no limits. And I believe that the limits are important, establishing who is the adult, who is the child. They let my child flourish and all that. Anyway, because of this, they will testify against me in the trial in police custody, saying that, yes, they will say that I am not a good mom because I think I have limits. And we have very different ideas on the education of children. She's my mother-in-law. She is my father's fifth wife, and she is. She really does it. It is very far from the way I was raised. And I want to raise my child more similar to the way I was raised, where we had a certain independence and we had borders and we knew what the rules were and what we expected from us. And with my mother-in-law, she makes no rule. She has no expectations. She just wants him to go wild and have whatever he wants. And it's good when you are a grandparent, but the problem is that I sometimes live with them. And when I'm in the same house with them. They should follow my period and not try to go and break all my rules anyway. Who makes sense. B yeah. At that time. B at that time, really frustrated because they don't listen to me. I feel lacking in respect. I feel, like, invisible. I just feel angry that they put my right to parents. And that's something I worked very hard. I went to school and I studied the development of the child. I rea D all the magazines, and I read the books, and I really. I know what I'm talking about. I feel confident in my parental skills and my parental abilities. And to have these people who have not done the same thing and who worked as hard as I have to be a good parent, try to tell me that I am a bad parent, it's really difficult to believe. So I feel very missed, unrelated, angry, frustrated, all these things. One yeah. I'm sorry. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B I take Benadryl to help me sleep, and I'm so much. My doctor gave me that. She gave me Benadryl, told me that I could take him to help me sleep. Last night, I was crying before falling asleep. So sometimes these thoughts start running at night when you're in bed. But I tried to push them, then I got up and I took my Benadryl so that I can fall asleep more easily. Are they triggered by something? B yeah. I still think of my son. Oh, I would like him to be with me and how unfair this is, and, as, I do not deserve that my son is removed from me because I am a very good mom, you know, and I am too hard with myself, then. But I am a good mom. And I am convinced that I am a good mom or just. I don't really have the money to take care of my son like my father. The father of the son does it. He has more money than me. And right now, I'm trying to agree because I know he can do more for him financially than I could. But that doesn't mean I'm not a good mom. How have you been feeling lately? B I'm quite depressed. I am on antidepressants. Take Wellbutrin. I've been on them for a few weeks now. I think they work. I don't know. I am not as low as I am. I mean, I arrived here today, I dressed, and I did it and I am here today, so not so bad. What made you ask for help? Hobo. Hmm. My husband complains a lot. He says I'm not the same person as me when he married me. He said that I was fun and that I was positive and that there were all these other optimistic things. This is another thing that he was on the phone that said to me last night and. And I am no longer these things, which is true. I mean, we got married a year ago, then my son was taken shortly after and. And it was just such a shock. And I just tried to come back, but it was difficult. R I understand. Did you think you had a problem before discovering it? B did I think I had a problem before discovering it? Discovered what? Oh yeah. I really like to cry sometimes. Like, I cry all the time. I don't need much to cry. I'm just crying, I think to cry. But, as, my family would invite me to family events and I would just go. Cry just because my son was not there where. I don't know. It's just all crying, I think. And as I said, my husband let me know that I am not the same. It is therefore disappointed and I feel bad even that I am not the same person he knew. I feel bad too. Another thing I feel bad, you know. Are you going to always in therapy now? B Yes, I do it. I try. Do you have the impression that therapy is useful? B do I have the impression that therapy is useful? Yeah. It's nice to talk about your problems. I go and cry every week. So, at least, I have a time defined every week when I can go and cry. It is. I mean, it's a version to be able to cry. Sometimes I feel better afterwards. Yeah. And she helps me make decisions, you know, help me be more proactive in my life. One like what? B well, I'm looking for jobs and things like that. And she gives me ideas about why don't you work here, why don't you work there? Have you thought about this or that? You know, then she said something, why don't you go back to school? And so I went to ask to return to school. You know, I don't do much with my life and sit all day long does not help my depression. So I'm trying to find a job. And I applied for the university in the fall. I was accepted in the hills of Dominguez, so I may go back to school in the fall right now. I'm still looking for work, but she helps me with this kind of thing. I just give myself ideas that life is not over, that there is even more, you know, I could do with life. Life. Yeah. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B Everything is always soft to be. I don't know. The last time, I was really happy. I don't know. To tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B My ideal weekend? Oh, I don't have much money because I don't work at the moment. So really my weekends spent reading. Maybe, but I can't really. I can't pay much attention when I read, so I have a short period of attention. I can only read a few chapters, but lately, I say that this is what I do is read. To Tell Me on something you recently did that you really enjoyed. B something I read. All right. I like to go to the USC. They have these nights when they have things like book signatures or poetry and art. This is called visions and voices. So I like to go out to their events and I generally appreciate Tho SE. A great. When will it go up the last time it happened? B about two weeks ago. Deborah Harkness was there to make a book signature for a discovery of witches. So, as I said, I try to be a writer. So I try to go above all to the signatures of the book and to see what it is to be an author who speaks to a crowd and to sign books. What are you most proud of in your life. B My son? How does your best friend describe you? B I don't have many friends. Do you know that you are some of your best qualities? B My best qualities? I am intelligent, I am beautiful. I'm really. I like a hard worker. I am dedicated to self -improvement. That's all I can think of at the moment. All right. A good. I think I asked everything. I need you. THANKS. Share your thoughts with me.

B I was really gifted in mathematics and sciences and I had an interest in planes. No, I am a life coach. Being a life coach and helping people. By telling me more about it. B I really like, really what it does to help others and see them grow and know that I made a contribution to their lives. A it's so good to hear. What are the things you really like?

Meditate and do yoga. What are the things that make you really crazy? B see. Really crazy, I guess I don't know about Mad. I don't get angry often, but frustrated, I would say, as being stuck in traffic or people that mean things for other people without real reason. What are you doing when you are annoyed?

B good enough to control my temperament. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone? What was it? B with my girlfriend, and it was a question of driving on the highway, and I suggested that she is recovering because there were road workers on the side, and she refused to do it and remained on the right track. So we discussed a little about it. How did you feel at that time? B I had the impression that she did not listen to me and almost as if she did not do at will what I suggested to be provocative. Do you often feel this way? B um, no. A it's good. What do you like to have to have fun? B Rollerblade, kayak, sing. I sing in a choir. What is one of your most memorable experiences?

To I would love to hear about one of your trips. B cool. Well, I made a trip to India and Nepal, my first time there. The first and a half week, I was with a large group of people and I had a meditation and yoga retirement and I had lived water rafting on the Ganga river. And then I left alone for the rest of the trip and I hike in Nepal with a guide there. And it was really beautiful in the Annapurna region. And then I returned to India and I explored the area near Tibet, then I went to Rajasthan and Tiger Park in Madhya Pradesh and I was, like, very close to Tigers. How did you decided to do this? B I was contacted by a friend of my friends and I said they were going on this trip and I had always wanted to go to India, so I decided to do it. R that looks like an excellent situation. B Yeah, it was really fun. How would your best friend describe you? B caring and enthusiastic for life. A it's good. Have you ever served in the army? B no. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. How easy is it for you to have a good night's sleep? B fairly easy. I don't sleep as well as I was when I was younger, but for the most part, I sleep well. From time to time, I will wake up, you know, at four in the morning or five in the morning when I want to sleep up to seven years and not be able to return to S Leep. But in general, it's pretty good. How are you when you don't sleep well? B I feel tired and not as motivated as usual and I sometimes want to take a nap in the afternoon. A good. Have you noticed changes in your behavior, thoughts lately? B no. A ok. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B 10 or 20 years ago, I also suppose. I would like to have invested money or bought like a house or something like that when I was younger. It would probably be the advice I would give myself. I am empathetic with other people, positive and have a positive perspective on life. Very determined. When I decide to do something, I will understand how to do it, even if it is difficult. I am very creative to find creative ways to do things. I guess the strongest thing is probably that I am quite balanced. I am very organized, but I am also quite creative, so quite balanced in this way. A it's good. How far are you from your family? B fairly close. Much closer than me when I was younger. Even if I would say that I am probably closer to friends and people who are in a spiritual community with me that I cannot arrive at my family. A good. What are the things that you usually put in a good mood? B being outdoors in nature and exercise and song. The fact that I went with it, I followed my heart and did what I wanted to do in relation to what I think I should do. A it's great. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? B I guess yesterday, I spent the day near the beach and I just bicycle and I went skating and I visited old friends there. How did you feel at that time? B was very relaxed and invigorated and I also felt like I failed to live near the beach because I lived very close to the beach. So I guess a little sad not to have lived there anymore, but really happy to be there. R I understand. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.

"A Belly. She looks more human than some of the therapists I've had. Really interesting. I mean, I think that's the point. She was way more compassionate. Oh, you haven't talked with her yet? Okay, so I'm going to put this here. Do I look up there? You just look at Ellie. The way this retraction works is that you talk. It goes behind your ears like this. So she's going to ask you a series of questions and then you can respond however you want. And when she sends, she should say goodbye. But if she, for any reason, pauses for like 10 to 15 seconds, something may have gone wrong. And so in either of those cases, press the button. B Alrighty. A Okay, so I'm gonna start up. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was crowded to talk to people and a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Alright, I suppose. A Where are you from originally? B Well, I was born in Philadelphia, but we lived all over the place. So I'm not from Philadelphia, I just was born there and lived there for a year. A All right. What are some things you really like about la? B I love the weather. People are generally more friendly than where I've lived on the East Coast. The scenery, the environment, the beach, the mountains, the bike paths and the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B The usual. The traffic, I guess some of the people in the entertainment business, a bit of the materialism and, you know, when you meet like the stereotypical ditz. A I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? B I used to when I used to have a life. I've been to 41 countries and I really enjoyed that. Wish I could do it again one day. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B I guess since I'm from nowhere, it's fun to go somewhere where you don't have to fit in. You're already a weirdo, so it doesn't matter that you're not from the place. And I just really enjoy meeting people from different cultures. I love seeing new environments. I love seeing historical things or, you know, just things of incredible beauty. I love meeting different types of people. Food. I love different food. So any foods from any foreign lands are always fun. And the other thing I secretly like that I try not to get too wrapped up in is that you can completely and utterly escape and forget about your real life. A I'd like to hear about one of your trips. B All right, let me think for a minute. Gee, I don't know which one to pick. I guess I'm trying to think in my head. I probably shouldn't be overthinking. I'm trying to think, do I pick a horrible one to give you guys more emotion or do I pick a normal one? Although I'm not so sure. My traveling companion was my, you know, husband, who, I don't know what his story is. I suppose he's gay. So we went to. To Singapore and it was just fabulous. I. Except for the parts having to deal with him, I loved being there. The, you know, the variety of delicious, unbelievable food. I'm a huge curry Laksha fan, so that was really fun. It's a big shopping place, so I kind of wished I were a bit younger because they had fabulous fashions. I liked the weather because it was hot and steamy. It was really easy to get around things like that. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Let's see. For some reason I'm thinking of a bad one. That is nothing, I assume you mean towards travel. When I was traveling through Vietnam and Cambodia, I got a really bad case of hemorrhagic dengue fever. I was in Hoi. No, I wasn't. I was in. I was in Huy. Sorry, in Vietnam. And I was horribly sick and I was hallucinating and my traveling companion, husband person, I. I said, please go get me some water. I was, you know, really sweating profusely and I'd been very sick for a while. And he went out to get the water, I don't know, sometime in the morning. And he came back at, I don't know, 7 o'clock at night or something and said that he'd. Some fellow on a motorbike had said, let me take you somewhere where you can get some water. And I don't know what the hell he did all day long. So I just think back to then and I remember coming in and out of consciousness and thinking, I'm going to die here. And I wondered if I would ever be, you know, found in this hotel we were staying. So I don't know, I survived. And I'm probably overdramatizing it, but it was just memorable because I often think back when I see people sick or whatever and think, gee, why the heck did I survive? That's not my PTSD thing. Though if you're wondering. A What did you study at school? B I studied film as an undergrad while I started off in dance. And then I realized I wasn't really that talented. I mean I was okay, but not really that good. So I moved over to film and I really enjoyed that. And then later on in life I went back to school and I became a lawyer. A What do you do now? B I'm an underemployed lawyer. I guess I got tossed out with many people. You know, I now understand why the, what do you call it, the, the age discrimination laws kick in after 40. Well, you know, it's extremely difficult to get rehired. So now I have a couple of clients, I make a couple of pennies, you know, would prefer to be fully employed. Not really going so well. That's why I'm here today to make my 35 measly bucks because after paying off all those loans and everything for law school, because I had stupidly picked one of the more expensive law schools in the country. So any of you students listening, don't do that. I mean, don't pick an expensive grad school if you don't get financial aid and you don't have financial help from your family. So anyway, because I was spent all my life paying off my undergrad and my graduate school, I now find myself looking down the barrel of long term unemployment and retirement and not having any, you know, any insurance or any enough for a what they say we're supposed to live to in the future. A Alright, what's your dream job? B I don't even know anymore. I don't, I don't have any dreams left. When I was younger, my dream job was to be an ambassador because I thought it would just be so much fun to, you know, have contact with different countries and to get to be friendly and meet people all the time and to represent your country in a positive way. I don't know, I don't think I have any dreams left. I'm too old. I have nothing that the world wants anymore. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Well, I was always extremely outgoing and friendly up until maybe, I don't know, five years ago. And then I, I guess I'm still friendly and outgoing. I just, sometimes I just give up and I don't even try anymore. A Why? B Well, it's embarrassing when people say, what do you do to say you're unemployed? Because people think, I've had so many people say, well why don't you just go out and get a job? Or they assume that you're being lazy or something like that. Where it's like, okay, assholes. I've worked since I was 12. You know, I didn't have fun during college. I worked three jobs to pay for it all. And my loans, I don't know. I guess I just stopped trying because. And I'm a little embarrassed about my situation. You know, I'm quote unquote married to somebody who has this secret life. I don't know what his story is. I guess I'm embarrassed about my life being, you know, pretty much a complete and utter failure of every goal that I had. A About your relationship with your family. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I go for a bike ride along the lovely bike path. I go swimming on occasion. I will drink, have a drink. I have a low alcohol tolerance, so basically one or two will pretty much knock me out. I don't know. I used to do yoga and stuff like that. Nowadays, I try to do deep breathing. A How are you at controlling your temper? B It depends who the person is in a normal situation with normal people or with complete strangers, I'm pretty darn good at it. With two people, I'm no longer any good at it at all. My husband and my mother, because they were both extremely physically and emotionally abusive. And I finally learned recently, in the last maybe 10 years or so, that that's the stuff that I accepted as normal was not normal. So I did all the assertiveness thing where you say, this is not, you know, please do not lie to me, or whatever the thing they were doing. And, you know, the person's supposed to say, oh, I didn't know that was hurting you. Let me change. But of course, that never actually works in real life. So now I find that if I must have contact with these people, which I one of them, I have to. I get extremely, you know, if they lie to me, I just get fed up and, you know, confront them on it. Well. Well, can you give me a chance? I guess it was my husband, since I'm paying the cell phone bill and he's on the family plan. It turned out that he had 44 pages of text while he's off on this secret trip to some summer camp. Don't ask. I don't even want to think about it. I don't know who these people are that he's texting with. So I asked him what the F. Are you. These texts. Who are you doing this with? And I tried calling some of the numbers, and the people would just hang up on me. So, you know, my imagination started thinking, what the hell is he doing at this summer camp? Why do the people that he's texting and texting photos to not respond? You know, draw your own conclusions? So, you know, and he wasn't answering me, and he kept lying in these one sentence emails he was sending back. So I, you know, I started giving these threats and the emails back, like, oh, yeah, well, if you don't tell me, I'm gonna call up this number and find out who they were. Which he wouldn't answer me. And then I. As I said, I called, and they. They would just hang up on me. So who knows who these people were? A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Well, I mean, there are the general life ones, like, I wish I had never married this person. A situation I wish I had handled differently. I guess I had a job. I actually was the head lawyer for a company. You probably won't believe it. Now, you guys who are out there watching this, and the president started doing all these things that were ethically wrong and going against my advice, and I should have gotten the Hades out of there. I should have quit immediately, but I was still paying off, you know, $200,000 worth of student loans, but I just should have gotten out of there. A What's something you feel guilty about? B Um, gee willikers. Well, I guess the. The only real thing I feel guilty about is something I'd prefer not to discuss on tape. I mean, I've had enough shrinks tell me over the years that I was justified. Hardest decision I ever had to make. I don't know. I mean, every stupid. A lot of decisions have been difficult. The hardest one, I have no idea. A Tell me about Neved or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B The last 49 years. I guess I could erase my big PTSD. When I was 18, a serial killer abducted me, and I escaped from that. I. A Have you ever served in the military? B No, I haven't. A How have you been feeling lately? B I don't know. You know, it's been a long. A Tell me more about that. B I don't know. Just neither here nor there. I'm just numb anymore. I don't really care. I'm just waiting for, you know, to die. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B Well, I kind of had a bad blow last week with something, and I just didn't have an appetite for like, I don't know, five days. And the horrible thing is I didn't lose a single pound. I don't know. A Can you tell me about that? B Let's see. I didn't have hunger, so I didn't eat and it didn't seem to affect my body at all. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Well, I seem to have developed some horrible neck pain and that's made things doubly difficult. The second thing is that I, because I'm always plagued by these horrible nightmares, they're actually just actual events that have actually happened to me just replaying over and over. I am an Internet addict and I just put stuff on YouTube or whatever on all night long. And you know, I frequently have loud, loud sound, so I don't sleep that well and I have a horrible, horrible bed at the moment and live in a very noisy place. Why do I live in a noisy place? Because I have been unemployed, as I told, or underemployed, as I told you, and I don't have money to live in a place that should be the equal of all the hard work I've done in my life. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B You're looking at it, you know, like anybody would be. I don't feel that well. I'm tired. I. I don't know, just tired. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Yes, a couple people that I've met with have told me that I had. How long ago were you diagnosed the first time? I don't know, maybe 15. The recurring nightmares, the. I don't know, I developed anxiety and I freak out, you know, if I think I'm gonna run out of gas. I get short of breath and. I don't know, in the stoop. I used to be able to handle anything. Now something stupid happens and I catastrophize it and think that it's going to be horrific. So I have to talk myself out of it. Oh, I've lost all the ability to trust and I'm numb to all feelings. Pardon me? Oh, well, I don't know what you said. A Can you tell me about that? B Well, you, you know, I think my PTSD, I was fine and I had it. After the 18 year old incident, I did fine and dandy. And then something happened. In the last like decade, I just had hit after hit after hit and it just brought everything back up and. Or maybe it's because I'm not that busy anymore. So I have time to ruminate over all these horrible things. And I've. It's a delayed thing. I'm way worse now than I was after the, you know, escaping from a serial killer. I mean, it's kind of, kind of a pain in the neck. Oh, literally. A How do you cope with them? B If I'm not being healthy, I will, you know, drink a couple things of alcohol, which I don't, I don't know, something's wrong with my heart. They told me and so anymore, you know, even if I have just one causes a lot of pain and stuff, or I try to do stuff to relax or, you know, if I'm having a really, really bad day, I might, I might hit myself or hurt myself in some other way. Because after you, after you do that, it releases all, you know, you're all freaked out. And then if you hurt yourself, you get really distracted, like, you know, this really hurts. And then you don't really think about the horrible thing that was in your head anymore. You're thinking about, I've got this pain. A What got you to seek help? B I don't know. I've tried to get help. I can't get any help now. I don't have any insurance. I can't. I'm not poor enough. I would need to go through all of my retirement savings and be penniless to get any free help. So I mean, I'd like to be a normal person again and I'd like to be happy. I'd like to be a functioning human, you know, like I used to be. No, I don't have the money and nobody cares about, you know, lower middle income class people. A Do you feel therapy useful? B You know, I've been to a gazillion therap. Not a gazillion, but, you know, I don't know, 15 therapists maybe over my 30 years or whatever it has been. Sometimes you get somebody that's good. And I found that the younger the person, the better actually like a couple. When I was in law school, I went to see someone or when my father died when I was 18, right. At the same time that other thing happened, I, I saw some students. They were actually the best ones. The worst ones seem to be the ones that are like in my age category or older because they've kind of checked out and they just want somebody who's there. But in terms of like, I don't know, I did that emd, whatever thing it was called once and didn't really, didn't really work. Sometimes you Get a nougat. Like once some therapist said to me, you don't want to kill yourself. You just want a different life. So when I am suicidal, I just think of that some. I don't want to kill myself. I just want a different life. So sometimes you get a nougat, but, you know, generally, it hasn't really saved me yet. A Tell me more about that. B Do I have to? I just did. Sometimes you get a good therapist. Oh. One thing I learned is that most therapists are actually more screwed up than me. You know, I may seem screwed up to you guys here, but, you know, at least I. I used to be able to function. I was somewhat successful, and I. I've never intentionally hurt people. I don't screw people over. I'm not dishonest in my work. I'm compassionate. And I found so many therapists. You know, they live their little teeny lives in suburbia or wherever the heck they're from, and they're totally incapable of relating to anything that's outside of their world. A What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? B Well, I haven't been, as I told you. So when I did go, I noticed that it was fun to go somewhere once a week and have somebody listen to your tales of woe. Although sometimes it got frustrating if the person was not helpful. A Mm. When was the last time you felt really happy? B Really happy? Um. I've been trying to cultivate it. So last night, I was on the bike path, and I looked around at the beautiful nature y things, and there were brief, literally, seconds where I had it. And then, you know, some aggressive bike rider or somebody else would come along and that would be destroyed. But otherwise, more than perhaps a brief second or a couple of seconds, I don't even know. I don't even know. Oh, I. It is good. Oh, my God. Are you even listening? I don't think you're listening very carefully. You're like some of the shrinks I've had. People. Is that what you wanted me to tell you about? I. I don't even know what the question was anymore, to tell you the truth. Sorry. Oh, no. Is this the empty silence that I'm supposed to be filling to answer? Where are you? What was the question? I don't know. Sometimes therapy is helpful. Sometimes it's not. Oh, the happiness. That was the question. Sometimes I've had happy. My happiest moment was when I climbed up inside the Great Pyramid of Giza. That was an extremely. I don't know. It was just a wonderful, wonderful feeling. I'm claustrophobic, so I was proud that I made it through there, and it was just an amazing sight. Gosh. Is this a test to see how one reacts when there's an uncomfortable silence? Am I supposed to be pushing the button for the person to come in now? Hello, there. All right, she did stop talking. I thought it was a test of how one reacts during an uncomfortable silence.",1,belli look human therapist realli interest mean think point way compassion oh talk yet okay go put look look elli way

Okay, so when she's on bed, she will let you know, she'll say goodbye, and then you're gonna press this button. A Okay. All right. B Thank you. A Okay. You're welcome. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything your age. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Yes. B Okay. So how are you doing today? A I'm doing fine. B That's good. Where are you from originally? A I'm from Los Angeles and born in Los Angeles. B Really? A Yes. B What are some things you really like about la? A You have a lot of places to go, a lot of people to see, a lot of things to do. B What are some things you don't really like about the lake? A Smog. The environment has changed over the years. I've been around since 1952, and I was born here in Los Angeles, and I see such changes as far as environmental with the smog and basically that's about it. B I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? A I've been several places in the United States, yes. B What do you enjoy about traveling? A Trying different type of cuisines. I like to go to museum, like historical. I'm a historical buff. Just going somewhere different than where. I've been here all my life. B I'd love to hear about one of your trips. A Let me start with. Try Boston. I had never been to Boston before. And when I went, I was able to look at the historical of the buildings and I went to. I saw the Lake Charles and the boats and stuff. It was just. It was a good experience. There's another place I went to. I took a ferry and my mind went on blank on it. God, I can't even think of it right now. But other than that, New Orleans. I've been to New Orleans. I didn't go to the Mardi Gras. I don't like to go to Mardi Gras when they have a lot of people. I just went on off season. I enjoyed that. I've been to Atlanta, Georgia, and I have taken a cruise. I went to the Caribbean, I took the Mexico cruise. My Next cruise I'd like to go to is Alaska because I want to be able to see certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet. As far as the environmental. B Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A I'm outgoing. As far as going places, I don't have a problem eating alone. I don't have a problem meeting people. I'm only shy in conversing back and forth to a stranger. B Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? A I have a favorite thing. I like to go on the Internet and I like to do sweet steaks. I'm a person that loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and I've been very successful since I was a kid. I've won a lot of sweepstakes and in the evening time, I find an hour of time and I just go online and just. I'm so good at it. I know just about exactly the right time to even enter. I usually try to enter them before midnight when everybody else is asleep. So it's been successful for me getting married and having my children. B Tell me about your kids. A I have a 27 year old son and I have a 31 year old son. Both of them, well, one of them is married and the other one's not. And I just not too long ago became a grandmother. So I have one grandson and my son, he works for the county of Los Angeles as a property conveyance examiner and the other one is a computer engineer. And I've been married for 33 years and basically my marriage is pretty strong. B That's so good to hear. Do you find it easy to be a parent? A You know what if you build a foundation with your children and have a good relationship with them and talk to them and find out what's going on and tell them that you love them. My son, I taught them all the time when they went out the door, I love you. And even today when they call me and hang up, they say, mom, I love you. You always have to give them that good feeling when they leave the door that you care. And I've never had to go to any jail to get them out. They've been pretty obedient. I mean, boys will be boys, but I never had any problem as far as them getting into any serious trouble and I'm very proud of that, especially the boys. I don't know how it would have been with girls. It may have been a little different. But boys, I have to say, they were pretty obedient and they respect the law. B What's the best thing about being a parent? A The best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you. And I watch my son, like I said, just a recent grandmother, and I watch him, how he handles his son. And it seemed like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home on how to handle his son, to be responsible, to go to work every day. And he knows that, hey, I got a wife, I have a son, and it's my job to make sure that I keep a roof over their heads so it pays off. And basically he treats her well. My mother was more stricter on me. My parents, for some unknown reason, I guess because my sister and I, we're the girls, they weren't strict on the boys, but they were more strict on the girls. So they didn't let us go to a lot of places. And then my parents also, they weren't type that like to travel. And I used to look at them and say, no, I'm not going to be like them. I'm going to travel. I'm not going to just stay home. I mean, there's nothing wrong with them because they found love at home and did things at home, but they never really traveled anywhere. And my mom used. She was afraid of planes, for one. And I used to try to talk her and get on a plane and go somewhere and she said, oh, I'm gonna go here, I'm gonna go there. But she never did. She died. She never had to do any trouble. So I made up for her. And I want to do something different, and that's to travel more than and be more out there. I was more of a social butterfly. My mother was not a social butterfly. So I made up for it. I think before I speak. And I am a type of person also, too, I take on other people's feelings before I blurt out the wrong thing. I try to analyze the situation first because sometimes you can open your mouth too soon, soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of. B When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? A It's probably something about my husband did. Oh, I know what it was. It's about. Well, probably over some new construction that my husband is working on on our house. We had a disagreement on that. Men have their own way of doing things. And I had told him not to use a Certain person to work on our house. But because of the personal relationship he has with this person, he went on ahead and now he sees all the downfalls. And he didn't listen. And so I didn't say, I told you so, but I guess he can tell by my facial expression that he'd have done wrong. And I told him, I said, look, you're losing money. And it became one problem after another. So now the construction thing is up in the air right now because he knows he has done wrong, but he doesn't want to face the fact that. Well, he knows it, but he doesn't want to really face the fact. So he says, look, it's my project. No, it's our project. So that's one of the biggest arguments that we have right now that I can think of that's recent. I felt that he didn't really listen to me. And he more so looked at a cheaper, economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways. Because I told him that you need to do your research. I'm the type of person, I do my research before I jump into something. I try to dot my I's and cross my T's. But my husband, he's not like that. He's like, oh, I can get this person and do this project for X amount of money. And he's a good friend of mine. Well, I don't care. I mean, is he licensed? He doesn't look at all that stuff. He just jumps into it, which cost him some extra money, unnecessary money that he spent. And I mean, it was a lot of money. And so I was really very upset. Yes, it did. I was very upset about it because it was just wasted money that we could have saved because we wind up doing the same thing all over again. And it didn't make any sense. B Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Differently. A I retired early. I was very fortunate to retire at age 50. I retired in 2002. I was working for the state of California as a disability analyst. And what happened was I was able. The reason why I was able to retire so early because I've been working since I was 18, and I had, like, 31 and a half years of service. And what was so nice about it that I only needed to invest in, like, 10 years in my health insurance, So I was able to get full health insurance. But the only thing about it, when you retire, I was with Calper. And I don't know if you're familiar with Calper, but we have an excellent retirement system. And since I had been working with them so long, I didn't get the full percentage. I should have stayed till I was 55 but I got out at 50 and I didn't get the full amount. But that's okay. I found myself going back doing a little part time job because of the economical reason. And then I have oneitis. So I think that was the kind of mistake I did. I should have kind of waited till I was 55 and 50. But I look at it now as far as the health insurance. I really benefited because of the rising costs of the health insurance have went up and I don't. I pay very little money so I think that over negates the money that I receive. B Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. A Let me see the hardest. It's probably when my mom died because I'm not used to anybody dying. My mother died in 99 of non Hodgkin lymphoma. And putting her funeral together, my brother and sister, we were never faced with anybody dying or putting a funeral together. And all the response because I am the eldest, it was put on me and I'm like oh my God, what do I do? And so I was kind of like left out there trying to find her insurance policy because I had asked her to make sure she put everything in order and she never got to it. So the hardest thing was going through her house and try to get all the stuff together and finding things. You know, I myself, I keep my things organized but for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized. And I think that was the hardest. And knowing how much I had to pay because I had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff. And unfortunately my mom, this is interesting, she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance. And she didn't die of course. What accident? She had a medical condition. So that was something. So we had to pay for the whole. Just about everything. Yeah, it was, it was. But now I can handle. This will sound weird but since that I've learned from that. So I have made it available for my children that my husband and I, we got together and we wind up getting our insurance policy. Not insurance policy, but what do you call the barrel insurance. We had that and it just. We've had it for many, many years. So it's almost paid. But this is 10 years. They'll pay for everything, the plot and everything. And another thing that I did, I even written my own obituary. I Know that sounds weird. So my son make one phone call. That's it. I don't want them to go through what I went through. And my husband agreed. That's the one thing we did agree on. And he said he don't want anybody to have any problem. People coming in and telling them what to do. It's already written. We did a living trust. I mean, it's nothing they can do but make one phone call and that's it. B How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? A I have no problem sleeping. I sleep very well. Pretty good. I'm getting a little tired, but that's only because of physical condition. I found out I have vitamin B deficiency and vitamin D deficiency. So it's more physical but not mental. B How do you help with that? A Exercise? Walk. Walking more. So have you noticed any changes in your baby? No, not really. B Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? A No. B Have you been diagnosed with depression? A No. B Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. A I'm basically happy all the time. I'm more so I'm making other people happy. I get more phone calls. People want inspiration about things when they have projects they're working on. And I try to encourage them. And it makes me feel good when they hang up and say, you know, hey, I really appreciate your input. Thanks. And then they. I'll follow up on them and see how they're doing. B That's so good to hear. How would your best friend describe you? A Oh, resource person. I've been described as a resource person from my supervisor to from my friends because I'm the type of person, I research everything. I get into just about. I just don't dive into any situation. I try to look up information. I know we have the technology here that you can get everything on the Internet, but also go back to the old school. Like even finding this place. I mean, I did the map, Google, but also I love the Thomas Brothers. I'm never going to give up my Thomas Brothers map Yellow Pages. You'd be surprised. I don't give up my Yellow Pages. So there's certain little things that I don't really let go. I know we have technology, but sometimes, you know, you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff that even though technology, you have it right at your finger, but you can find things. And they say I'm more of a resource person. Most people come to me just the look of things and I get that spunk about it because I like to look for stuff and find it and that gives me satisfaction. I wish I could stuff. Going up and down on my weight, I'll lose weight. I'll go on this big diet before the summertime and then by Christmas time I have what they call a yo yo weight problem. And if I can stop binging and making food, my friend, I think that's just a nervous disorder. I like to eat, but also I don't like to be overweight either because I have plenty of beautiful clothes at home and I can't get them at on right now. So I know myself. I'm going to go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so I can get in some nice clothes. So it's mostly not happier with my weight. That's it. Yeah. B Is there anything you regret? A I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. B Is there anything you regret? A No, not really. I regret and I can't stay skinny. I can't lose. I mean, I can lose the weight, but I regret not being able to keep it and fall back on. Putting the weight back on. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A Let's see, by 10 or 20 years ago, I would have saved a little bit more money before I retired and basically putting away more money before I retired instead of retiring too early. Most proudest of my life, meeting a lot of people that came in my life. I got good friends. I still have 15 of the best friends that I went to elementary school. And very rare you could find anybody to walk around and say they have the same 15 group of friends. We were in sorority together, went to college together, lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact, we just had. All of us had our 60th birthday and our high school group. We put together a 60 year birthday reunion. And here, all 15 of us, with the exception of one, we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact. So I think it's basically keeping the same friends. I think we can probably outlive each other. Okay. B Thanks for sharing your thoughts. A You're welcome. Bye Bye. Okay.

"A good. All right. B Very good. So now I'm going to put this door again here. When she was finished, she will let you know and then you can press this button to let me know. All right? A good. B Thank you. A good. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And don't hesitate to tell me. Nothing. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? A yes. B ok. So how are you today? A I am fine. B is good. Where do you come from? A south. The. B really? What are the things you really like? Has time, women, opportunities. That's almost everything. B What are the things you don't really like at it? Racism. Police brutality. Injustice. Yeah, that's all. B I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? Why? A type of exploration exploration. B ok. What are you studying at school? A psychology. MM. B How did you decided to do this? A was one of the classes in which I excelled the most. So I decided to change it from business to psychology. B are you happy that you did that? One yeah. Yes. B Do you still work in there? A B number What is your dream work? A to own my own record company. B well. How difficult is it? R it's moderately difficult, but you know, take it one day at a time. I suppose, you know, stay focused. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A bit of both. B Why? R I tend to be shy in the situations with which I am not comfortable or I am new. And I am going out in places with which I am more comfortable. B uh huh. One yeah. B Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? A return the low lights and listen to soft music. B is good. How are you going to control your temperament? I am improving over the years. I think I'm quite decent now in relation to what I was. B Did that cause you to trouble? A yes, madam. B Can you tell me? R because of the absence of, I suppose you could say controlling my emotions, I have. Incarcerated. Sent to prison? Yeah. B ok. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to make. A I am not sure. I don't really remember my most difficult decision I made in my life. B when you go back the last time you discuss D with someone and what was it? R It was probably a few days ago with the girl I was talking about, and I was arguing her lack of communication and attention. Yeah. B How did you feel at that time? A frustrated. Because, you know, you make a certain effort and you expect, you know, the same effort of the other person when you are in a relationship. Then, at the same time, when you. When you have expectations, you sometimes prepare for failure. So you know, I guess I learn. B tell me about a situation you want you to manage differently. A there are a lot of situations that I would manage differently. The most recent was probably that I had a physical altercation with an inmate when I was incarcerated. And it did me. This is what sent me to prison. And. And I had to have a lot more time. And if I managed it differently, I would probably never have gone to prison, and I would probably have been at home much earlier than that originally. Yeah. B tell me about an event or something you want you to erase from your memory. A There are several events that I would like to be able to erase from my memory. Probably my first girlfriend. She did something really extreme. It was not necessary in my eyes, and it could have cost me my life. I think it is a recurring thought that I would like to be able to completely erase my memory with good memories. Some fights, I guess you could say. Shootouts, blow yourself up, be robbed. You know, these things, I think these inhibit me, I suppose, to explore certain areas of life with which I am not comfortable. So these are the few things that it will be good if I could erase it completely. B yeah. It seems really difficult. One yeah. B What do you feel guilty? A injuring people who didn't need to be emotionally injured, especially. Some women in my life are in my past. Probably putting my mother through certain things that she did not have to cross, with my close friends and my family too. B tell me about your relationship with your family. It was rocky while growing up, but as they get older and ripening, and the certain experiences that I lived brought me somehow from my family. So now it's. It's quite decent. It's quite decent. B it's great. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? R I would say my mother. Yeah, my mother. B Can you tell me? A UM, well, she had her share of experiences, negative and posted IVE. I admire her the difficulties she went through. She has experienced difficult economic difficulties while growing up, but that did not prevent her from raising a son at a young age, to finish his studies, to obtain his mastery and to be in the whole of a good person. And she also fought against mental health problems. And probably not the best of the family with which she could have been raised. It is therefore a bit like an inspiration for me and the others too. So I would say my mother. B How easy for you to have a good night's sleep? It is not easy. So, yes, it's not easy. B Why? R I couldn't tell you. I. I have always had sleep problems. I used to take as free sleep drugs free or nyquil, but that makes you sleep the next morning. It's like. It is a negative effect. Really. Yeah. B are you triggered by something. In The Medica? I don't know. I don't know. But I just stopped taking it because I didn't like feeling sleepy. B How have you been feeling lately? A step good at all. B Can you tell me? One yeah. I mean, I was recently released from prison not so long ago. I am older now and many more responsibilities and I have the impression that my life is not where it is supposed to be. I have the impression that I could have made many more decisions in my life, you know, sometimes sorry for myself and just things that I have experienced and the nine whole yards. So, yes, I'm sorry. Everything is fine. B There are always compromises in life, right? A YEP. It's true. B Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? A yes. B For how long have you been diagnosed? About two and a half years, three years ago. B What made you ask for help? One myself. I was just tired of not. I don't know, I guess school made me get help because I started to understand how my brain works, you know. So I decided to seek help maybe to improve my life. Yeah, you could say that. B are you happy that you did that? Yes, I am. B you are still going to therapy now? A yes. B Do you feel that therapy is useful? R Yes, I do, actually. I do. B What kind of changes have you noticed since you have been in therapy? Better decision -making, better tools to think about choices, how to better control certain situations. Yeah. B Can you give me an example? A well, instead of always reacting on emotion, whatever the type of emotion, I take a step back and evaluate the situation, you know, to see what is the best way to react to the situation. And in doing so, it made me more mature, emotion Ally more mature and just has a positive result. B tell me about the last time you felt really happy. R I was next to a beautiful woman who cared about me and the feeling was mutual. So it was probably the happiest. B How would your best friend describe you? An oh my god. Spontaneous, outgoing. Sometimes a little crazy pleasure. That's almost everything. B What are the things you want to be able to change about you? Nothing. B is there something you regret? One as I said earlier, just, you know, injuring the few women who were in my life, my past and my friends and my family. That's almost everything. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? An oh, shit. The school was really important. How I wear myself, the people I surround myself and what I choose to do during my free time. These are the few things I would say. B What are the things that usually put you in a good mood? Good music, a good basketball game. Sex. B tell me about something that you recently did that you really enjoyed. A well, I like to go out. I like to go to the holidays, social gatherings where everyone is friendly and there is no drama.

Thank you for your patience. C hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming. Come today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started and do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. C then, how are you today? B say again. Say again. C large. Where do you come from? B San Bernardino, California. What are the things you really like? B Time is beautiful. What does anyone like it? It's very sunny and I like people here. I don't like how spread it is. And with that, I don't like the lack of public transport and I don't like everything to stop at 2 a.m. an introvert? Yes I do it. C why? B Why? Because I tend to be very stoic. I don't tend, I don't know, express myself so much and I tend to be very reserved and not really to come on my feelings, etc. C sometimes, when I feel tense, I turn on the screen saving of the fisheal fish. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I'm not sure I understand exactly the question, but me. I can't really say. I'm coming. I just get back in me and I don't tend to express what I think or feel. If it makes sense. Say again. Say again, please. What do you do when you are in Hawaii? What should I do when I'm alone? I do a lot of bikes . I make a bike like very, like everywhere. I am a bicycle nave that I also like when I am alone, like on the bus. I'll read. I will bring a book with me and I will read a lot. C How are you going to control your temperament? B I am very good at controlling my temperament. I don't want to, I mean, I'm so good in repression, repressing my feelings that I very rarely express. I mean, I don't know, I don't really express anger. In addition, I don't really feel anger because I'm not an angry person. I may be very disappointed with when something bad happens, but I will not have fun in a rage. I don't really feel rabies, but you know, I am sort of exposed all the time on the road. I see people like, you know, shouting on each other and screaming and that is. Yeah, I like to cultivate my serenity. When is it going back the last time you argued with someone? B the last time, I discussed with someone, it would have been an argument linked to employment. And what have I studied at school? I studied English, American literature. Currently, I am unemployed. My most recent work was as a tutor. Before that, I was editor of grants, payroll clerk. I had an assortment of jobs. C that sucks. It can be difficult to find a good job these days. B Yeah, I agree. I agree. What is my dream work? I would like to be a publisher. I would like to edit publications or like to write stories, stories for publications. I feel more comfortable being a publisher. I feel more comfortable working with prose than with, I suppose, as producing mine. So I like to be like an publisher of publications. C really? B yeah, yeah. Travel a lot. I'd like to travel. I have already traveled. One of my most memorable experiences. I. C How far are you from your family? B I'm quite close to my family. I returned here to be closer to them about two years ago from Chicago. And so I'm closer to them now. But I don't know, it was a kind of error in a professional way because I have nothing able to get out here and I should probably have stayed in Chicago. Who is someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B still say? I'm sorry, I don't really understand. C tell me more about it. B I'm afraid. Well, Chicago, it was fun there. I worked as an editor of grants. And I went there for higher education, but I ended up giving up higher education, but finding work and staying there for five years, I really liked it. C How do you like your life situation? B My life situation? I agree with that. Right away. I live with a parent. It could be Better, but right now, it's like. Right now, I'm unemployed, and it's like being saved, winning for free. And so I'm fine at the time I am, but I really need to find another job so that I can stabilize myself. Yeah, I live with my uncle, and, you know, as I say, it's its place, and so it is a bit eccentric. I don't know how to describe it elsewhere. He's pretty there, but he's a good guy anyway. C have you already served in the army? B do I have a source of what? I'm sorry, do I have one. I can really hear what you say, and it is difficult for me to understand you sometimes, but I will wait for you to answer me again or that you say, ask me the question. C agree. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B No, I didn't do it. C agree. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B No, I didn't do it, but I often felt depressed, but I have never had a diagnosis of depression. C agree. How do you feel recently? B I have been feeling good lately. I mean, relatively. I mean. I mean, apart from being unemployed and feeling, as, really anxious, it is, you know, I am in a position where I can, you know. You know, I can't somehow survive here, which is important. And, you know, I am not safe, which is important. So I feel good. I mean, yes, I could do much better. On the other hand, I am not on the street and things could be much worse. It's good. Have you noticed changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B No, I didn't do it. C can you tell me? B I don't know what the. The question was. I thought you had said a kind of therapy. I have already been in therapy, but this is not the case. I don't know. I was mainly therapy for, like the therapist, and I was really not, like, really. It didn't really help me so much. I suppose, like solving my problems. But I like to speak to the therapist, and I suppose that it is a bit like a situation parallel to this scenario, to speak to a virtual human. You just have someone to sit for a while that will listen to you. It can be very soothing, especially to have a pleasant personality. Are you often feeling this way? B am I often feeling this way? Well, do I feel like I need to talk to someone very often? Sometimes. I mean, yes, I like to suppress emotions like a sense roughly. I guess if I had to be close to someone, I would have someone I could share with my thoughts and feelings. But. And it's like, I guess you can say that I feel. What is the word? I feel alone. But. Or Not alone but I am a bit like very contained inside. What is the word? In my own sense of oneself, my own feelings and I do not really need to contact as much because I am a practical god. I practice meditation and I am in a way, it helps me somehow as a kind of retreat in me and as a bit like finding, finding serenity, a sense of. A feeling of serenity. Serenity by a lack of desire. And so it helps me, I mean, I suppose that like loneliness, but also, I may mean that it also provokes as you know, as a problem and you know, I do not contact people as often as I, as I should and I certainly neglected relationships because of that. And all this can be like a self-centered, you know, but I try. Yes, it's like I wanted to try to find a way to like to engage with people without really allowing me to drop them, so to speak. And it is therefore one of the things that prevents me from reaching out to people is the idea that I could potentially drop them if they had to put their faith in me or their confidence in me. And so I'm very reluctant to do that. Continue. How is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B How easy for me? I don't really do it. Again, I only hear part of what you say and therefore it will reject my answer. I would say it's very easy. I mean I can't really, I don't really understand the question, but continue. How are you when you don't sleep well? B What does it think about what I am most afraid? Probably the most afraid of Ah, God. Be a failure or not be a success. Do not find a stable job, not being able, I mean, to settle, to get married mainly. It is. I do not know, I agree to be single, I do not agree to be unemployed. And so it's like one of these things. It's like, I'm just. I don't think I can reach out to people too because I don't have a job. And it's like, I don't want to bring them to my. To make my life fair. Right away. I am unable to have people. I mean, having a lot of friends, so to speak, because I can't really go out and I can't, you know, spend money. In restaurants or in clubs or something else. So I'm a lot on a bike, and me. I think a lot. I meditate a lot and me. I read a lot of literature. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? B when when I went back the last time I felt really happy? Well, last weekend, I was at my. My aunt and the 50th wedding anniversary of the uncle. And It was a great opportunity. It was really one. It was. Their whole family was there. Our family was there. And it's like my own parents, the 50th anniversary is coming. 50, 50 years together. And I felt really happy for them. I felt really happy that I guess the two had provided us like, really. A very good childhood. And it seems strange, I suppose, with this kind of starting point, like that. I mean. I mean, for, yeah, I suppose, I like to wade at the moment. But I felt happy for them, I think. I suppose that opportunities like this will probably become rarer at the level of society, but it is a bit like beyond my kind of area of ​​happiness. Anyway, it's good. But, yes, I feel happy this weekend that my aunt and uncle. 50th wedding anniversary. Other than that, I generally feel happy when I am on the road by bike and I go fast enough. C Nice. How would your best friend describe you? B My best friend, in fact, she would describe me as depressed all the time. And I asked him questions about it because I asked him if being around me had shot her because she was crossing her own very deep depression. And I tried in a way, as, as, but at the same time I was going to depress myself. And so I asked him if being around me dropped it. And she said no, it's. It did. I mean, it made her happy that me. That I was interested in her. But. What is the word that like my. In a way, as my depression was not, as, really had nothing to do with its depression. It was. His depression was, as, completely unrelated to, as I felt. And so, as, I do not know, in our two cases, it was just good to have someone else to be with whom had a certain respect for, I suppose, as we felt or, as, our mutual genre, like the lack of feeling, if I can say it in this way. And so, yes, that's how she would describe me. I mean, as you seem very depressed all the time. And she was my best friend right now. Is there something you regret? B What I regret? Very well, thank you. Bye. Good morning. Bye. Bye. Good morning. How are you? B It was rather interesting. It's like, I should have. I told you I had, like. My ears are a bit. They are a little obstructed. And so I had problems, like hearing it at some point. At times. I'm sorry. You can take the microphone. B ok. But I tried, as, answer it. One yeah.

B can cultivate a spirit and love someone unconditionally. What are the ways that you are different as a parent than your parents? B Well, I went through a lot of trauma when I was a child.

C Visit new places, meet other people, eat different foods, see other cultures, this kind of thing. B I would like to hear about one of your trips. C I went to Spain recently and it's a little more relaxed life. They do not work the same hours as Americans, different culture, they take a lot of breaks, rest in the middle of the day, especially in summer when it is really hot. Totally different food culture. They go to bars and restaurants much later, remain open later and you know, it's just something new. It was exciting and you know, I can't wait to see other types of destinations like that. B What is one of your most memorable experiences? It goes to Spain with all my former secondary friends. I hadn't seen them for a while and we did a big tour in Spain. We went to Madrid, Barcelona, ​​Valence. We had a good time, you know, spent a few weeks there and you know, you were able to relax and have fun. B What have you studied at school? It was a com Puter Science Major. B What are you doing now? C I advice. B ok. What is your dream work? C Job Dream? I probably want to start going to finance. I want to do something related. Investment bank. I think I'm going to change course very soon here. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I am a little more shy. B What would you say about your relationship with your family? C my family is good. We are a little closed. We do not show much emotion and we are not as loving by phone or in person. But we have other ways to show our emotions. B Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. C yeah. B What are you doing to relax? C usually, I'm just going to watch a movie or go to the movies, go to the park. I have a small dog, so I like to take it around the block. So it usually relaxes me a little. B How are you going to control your temperament? C I am generally quite good. I am not really extremely angry very often. You know, I keep a lot of my emotions inside, which is not always good. But, you know, I never have mad excavation in angry and that I become violent or something like that. B when was the last. The last time, you argued with someone and what was it? C the last time I argued with someone, it was a few weeks ago. We were in fact in Las Vegas and, you know, we were with a large group of people and we were just trying to decide where to go. And one of my friends was quite categorical in a place and it was unattractive for the rest of the group. So you know, it's a bit conflicting, but everything finally happened at the end. B tell me about a situation you want you to manage differently. C I think the death of my mother's father. I would have liked to be a little more loving and emotional for my mother on this subject. You know, it was a very difficult time for her and I should have been there a little more than me. B What do you feel guilty? C I feel guilty for not being as loving and attentive to my parents. I mean, they did a lot for me and provided a lot. And I don't always really show them my gratitude. I think as much as I would have liked. SO. B tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. C The most difficult decision I ever have. B or something you want to be able to erase from your memory. C something that I want to have been erased would certainly be when I was arrested for a dui. Very embarrassing moment, but, you know, I want it to never be arrived. B Have you ever served in the army? C no. b How do you receive yourself recently? It was a little sad. Had another death in the family recently. My uncle died a few weeks ago. It was therefore a little difficult for all of us. And you know, we are all distributed in the country, so it's difficult. We cannot really be together in person, which makes things difficult. B I'm sorry to hear that. Have you noticed changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? C very recently. I mean, I think I was a little more disappointed and, you know, a little more than, you know, normal. So you know, I'm sure it will turn around soon, but sometimes some of these things take time to heal. B tell me more about it.

A good. B Very good, great. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B Yes, I'm fine. A good. So how are you today? B I'm doing very well today. I feel good today.

B My family is no longer there. I returned for high school meetings. How does he compare himself to the? B is much greener. It is very green, very small, very woody. This is where I played in the woods when I was a child. We swim in careers. I have bicycle everywhere and here, it's a little more cement and traffic. How is you easy to get used to living in Los Angeles? B It looked like cement at first, but I love it now and I have friends and I love being able to do so many different things. And I go a lot to the beach. I also get into the mountains. I'm going to camp all the time, so I love it. I love him. Always opportunities. R I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B I traveled a lot. I was in the Peace Corps and I was in South America. I was in Paraguay for three years and I traveled across South America. Brazil, Peru, Chile, Bolivia. I also spent a year in London, I traveled throughout Europe and I often went to Canada. I would love to go to Asia one of these days. A wow. What do you like on travel? B Meet new people, food. I love to try new food and simply have a different perspective on the world and the perspectives of different people on the world because America tends to isolate itself. To I would love to hear about one of your trips. B I hike on the Inca trail when I was in Peru. It was a five -day hike from Cusco. We hiked because I think four or five days and we woke up the last morning at the Sun Gate by Machu Picchu. And it was only the most incredible experience because I would not. I had seen each other. I saw him in National Geographical, you know, all my life. So being there and an experience that was phenomenal. A great. What have you studied at school? B Philosophy. I have my diploma in philosophy. I undermined in art. Well, I started in business, and I became very disenchanted with it very quickly, and I therefore decided to study what I wanted to study while I was at university and I had the opportunity. So that's what I wanted to do. And everyone advised me because you cannot find a job as a philosopher. But I had the idea of ​​obtaining my diploma in philosophy, then going to the Faculty of Law and being a teacher of ethics, but this kind of collapsed. And it is in fact as I ended up joining the Peace Corps. So everything worked. I'm sorry. Yeah. Sorry, my alarm is triggered on my phone. He will die in a second. Okay, I'm sorry. It's always going. Sorry, I turned off the phone, but I forgot to turn off the alarm. You go. Okay, well, I'm sorry, what was your question? My dream work. Gosh. By writing. I did some scripts, some scenarios with one of my friends, but I don't really want to do the Hollywood thing. But writing and teaching and traveling, if I could do it abroad. Do you consider yourself more shy or out? B outgoing. Do I have to deactivate my alarm? He continues to go here. Oh, I can't move. All right. I can't go to my bag. Okay, I'm sorry. Yes, me. I turned off my phone, but I didn't turn it off. The alarm is like. I forgot that it is my alarm of going to yoga. I'm terribly sorry for that. All right. Sorry for the interruption. A good. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I have a real aquarium at home, and I do the same thing, and I do it with my children. When they are upset, I watched them in front of fishing fishing and it is very relaxing. I also try to meditate. I try to sit down and shut myself up and bring my thoughts together. I like to read. Or sometimes I walk. I'm going to do my dog ​​for walking. How are you going to control your temperament? B I want to be able to say that I was good in this area, but generally I tend to have explosions from time to time when things become too chaotic at home, and I feel very underestimated. I will have a burst of anger. Yeah. My husband does not appreciate it. And I have never done it at work or in a social situation, but at home with my family, I did it. And then instead of recognizing that I am upset, my husband tends to obtain angry with me to be crazy. And then it degenerates. And sometimes I'm just. I end up going out or going to my room. Hmm. I'm sorry. How are you facing this? B usually, after having an explosion and I is a little isolated, I can come back relaxed and face the situation in a quieter way. How difficult? B Sometimes it's very difficult. But I got to the point where I just know to stop and get out of there and go breathe deeply, then really try to understand what I feel, why am I angry, why am I so tense? Then be able to verbalize this. To tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B well, it happens a few times when I start to get. I had a very tense day and things did not happen. I tend to have explosions in the kitchen while I prepare for dinner and the children are all at home and they ask me questions about their homework or they turn on television and my husband bothers me about things I don't need to think at that time. And once, I just said, okay, everyone outside the kitchen. Leave me alone. To go out. Let me finish dinner. And no one would. And I just had more pressure that accumulates and accumulates, and I was actually taking one of the pots and I hit it against the stove very difficult to make people pay attention to what I said. And I made a bump in my stove, which is still there, so that I should have come out earlier and take my deep breaths before doing this. It was probably when I was pregnant with my first child. I was not married. I had a very good friend. I was 32 at the time, so I was. You know, I was not young. I think if I was younger, I would probably have decided to have an abortion. But at that time of my life, I agree, I will have this child. And I had. I got pregnant with the man with whom I married and that we are still married, but we only go out for three months, and I lived with a good friend to me. With whom I was in the Peace Corps. And her. And so I didn't know this guy very well. I did not know if we could raise a child together. I didn't know if I wanted to get married and raise a child with someone else. And my friend suggested that I raise the child together. Even suggested to move to Costa Rica to raise the child together. And so it was a lot of huge decisions that were going to determine the rest of my life. And I made the decision according to more communications on meaning and practicality. But I do not regret this decision. I think I made a good decision to marry my husband and raise our child. A Tell Me on your children. B They are older now. My elder is 17 years old. He is at DA Vinci Science School. He is really in engineering. He obtained his pilot license, of which I am very proud of him for him. My daughter is 15 years old and she likes to play. She has a boyfriend whom they see once a week in church and they were constantly text. She is a young woman of 15 years very, very typical. And then I have a 12 year old child. It is extremely active and is in constant motion and always makes noise. But I love her very much. He is in the climbing and there is a climbing gym near us. So there is a subscription there. So he goes there and the rocks climb almost daily. Did you find easy to be your parent? B No, I find it extremely difficult. I was not. My mother had a very. My father died when I was young and my mother was disconnected when it happened. So I did not have a very warm or loving relationship with my mother or my childhood. And I rose essentially. I was in a way to me from a very young age. I mean, she was at home but I really had no interaction with her. So, I really had no parental skills with which you know, most people are high. I know what not to do, but sometimes it's very, very difficult. And I see my friends who have, you know, these very innate parental skills. It is very hot and you know, they make cookies and everything is organic and they knit everything and you know, their house is always perfect and it is as if I am not that person. So I try and that I am. I think I am a very good mother. But I am not a typical mother. I think I'm more. I am more creative often and we do a lot of things, but it is not a kind of warm, blurred and comfortable thing. In fact, when we are going to camp, it's more. I am more intimate when I'm going to camp than at home. I think I'm more tense when I'm at home. But I try, as, by meditation and things of this kind, I try to become calmer and more patient. I think my patience is what I have to work the most. I was an insomniac all my life. I remember as a child lying in my bed, looking at the stars cross the window of my room. And I haven't slept well for a long time. But I realized that if I do the exercise and do something with my brain intellectually during the day, I must be physically tired and intellectually tired to sleep well. And It is. Sometimes it's difficult to do. And so often I remain awake in reading. I will read until midnight, then I will try to fall asleep. And generally, I will not come back, even if I wake up again to three and to things of this kind. But I will try to go back to sleep. Yesterday, I didn't feel so well. I think a lot should depend on the weather. And everything was cloudy and gray yesterday because I intended to work on my garden. And then I have a butterfly garden in my courtyard before, so I had more planting to do and I just didn't want to do it. So, I just sort of pidicated and lost a lot of time yesterday. But today, I feel really good, so I feel more positive, I feel more energy. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B I don't know. I just received a new mattress, in fact. It didn't really help me sleep. But it was really good because I have needed it for a very long time. And I was just a little excited to be delivered and installed. And it looks like, so banal, but it was, you know, just like, I finally do something positive because it is something that I pushed and that I pushed back, I pushed back. And it was like, finally there and concrete. And it's like, okay, I did this task that I can check my list. But also, I took the children to camp during the spring holidays, and we just had a fabulous time. And we sat down to tell stories about the campfire and do ses and things like that. And this kind of time makes me very happy. How would your best friend describe you? B I don't know. I think she believes that I am more intellectual and more intelligent than I think I am sometimes. So she comes to me with a lot of problems. She always requests advice to me. She thinks I give her good advice, and when she doesn't know what to do, she will ask me. And then sometimes, she just calls me to run things like, to complain because I am sympathetic or empathetic and I am right there to listen. And I don't need to give him advice. So I think that a good listener and good advice. What are the things you want to change about you? B I procrastinate a lot. I start projects and I don't finish them. So this is what I am working on at the moment, I end a lot of projects that I have launched in recent months. Many of them are really creative projects, and I am very enthusiastic about them. When I start them and I will be almost finished, then I don't know what's going on. I get lost completely. Sometimes I think it's because I'm afraid to finish them, which seems a little strange, but I work on it. I try to do them. Oh my God. Do not follow the opportunities I had. When I got out of the Peace Corps, there were a lot of things in which I could enter. I could have gone to get my master's degree on a grant and things like this. But instead, I got pregnant and got married. And I had a wonderful job that I really liked and really appreciated. But when I got pregnant the second time, it was just at a time when I had to fight for a direction. And I made my limits where I could not be pregnant and have this child and. And do everything I had to do to get a direction. And so I really wish it. So I resigned. And I would have liked to stay with that because I would have had a much more fulfilling and enriching and solid career. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B not to base decisions on emotions. Sometimes I. and not. I had very bad bosses. The jobs were wonderful, but my ego bothered and I would have said to let go of this aspect of the work, to let go. The selfish reactions I had in bosses, and focus on work and do it very well. My children, in fact, and also my experience of the Peace Corps was simply phenomenal. And people are really interested in this, and they are, as, they admired that they really know someone who did this. So that's. I always. When I was little, my neighbor was one of the first people to enter the Peace Corps when he started. And I always said, oh, I want to do this one day. I want to do this one day. I want to do this one day. And then finally I got to the point where I said, I must be silent or do it. So that. It was one of my thinner experiences. A it's so good to hear. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. B ok. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. THANKS. A farewell. B bye.

"To you. B ok? Very well, I think I got it. To this must. Yeah. Be far from your mouth so that it works. B ok. Like that? Yes, for any reason, otherwise it does not work. B agree, so it's Ellie. Okay, I guess. An oh no, I guess I'm going to start recording. Okay, then yeah, she will just ask you a series of questions and then when she has finished, she should say goodbye. But if for any reason, it stops for more than 10 to 15 seconds, something may have turned badly and you can press the button otherwise, when it says goodbye. And for the moment, she cannot answer any questions. She can only ask questions. Just so that you know. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B well. A it's good. Where do you come from? B San Francisco. Well, what are the things you really like at the? B beaches, homes, ocean, films, entertainment, business. The different areas, the weather. What are the things you don't really like at it? B It is really difficult to move by bus. It's terrible not to have a car. This is the most difficult part. You can't really do the car without any points of view. Do you travel a lot by bus? I do. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B My most memorable experiences. What did you study at school? B oh, what did I studied at school? I studied. Studied. I'm studying the game right now, that's what I'm doing. What are you doing now? B I study the theater and I work a day work that does not pay enough money. So I'm trying to find additional day jobs or I don't know how. I try to understand how to live with joy. It's how to live with joy. This is when your life flows, it is when you do more what brings you joy. This is my current dilemma. What is your dream work? B I think that my dream work would weigh 70 pounds less and be a really emotionally diversified actress so that I can play comedy roles, which is easier for me, and heavy theater roles, which is more a challenge to be vulnerable and to open emotionally. So that's what I'm studying right now. And I would look at the thousand percent better because my hair would be long. I really think I have no families Ly plus. My father died, and there is no relationship with my sister and a very poor with my mother. It is therefore almost like no longer having a family. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B Take a shower. How are you going to control your temperament? B pretty well. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B I guess it was a few months ago, and it was a friend who threw me. To tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B It would be the situation I would have liked to manage it differently. R which you feel guilty? B Infidelity. To Tell Me on the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. B This is a good question. The most difficult decision I ever had to make. Well, I had an incredible cat. And if you can imagine it, it was more than a cat. It was like a being, a very large entity in a cat's body. And my cat died, and I had to do it. I wanted to have an appropriate burial in an animal cemetery and have a commemorative service for my cat. And my mother was against these ideas. It was too much for a cat. And so it took me two and a half months to find the money to find his coffin and decide the style of coffin that I wanted. Because it was so difficult to have this decision when I received no support. But finally I triumphed. And I found a craftsman in Tennessee who makes cedar chests. And he made me the most beautiful coffin in cedar. Octagonal. Octagonal with ivory lining and plush pad inside the coffin. And the people of the animal cemetery said that in 20 years of activity, they had never seen such a beautiful coffin. And they had never seen someone who gave their animals so much. So I really felt, really good when I saw the way I wanted to send my cat a little, you know, in the cemetery. In Tell Me Sur Nevette or something you want to be able to erase from your memory. B OH, an event that I could erase from my memory. I think I have erased many events from my memory. Well, I probably had a lot. Strange experiences. Certainly. Have you ever served in the army? No. A good. How do you feel recently? B well, you know, I am a very determined human being. So I work to be in positive states of mind. But overall, I think I definitely realize that I have a deep depression and an essential I need more than one support network here to. I need to create a new family and that's essentially what I really have to do. Which is difficult because it is difficult to have a family, family and friends, people you can really, really confidence. And it is simply difficult to get around the car without car. So I feel a lack of support in my life and I feel isolated and lonely. Other than that, I am very optimistic. Changes in my behavior? Yeah, I walk at work, which is in Beverly Hills and I walk in Beverly Hills and I noticed that even if I walk in beautiful places, I am without joy when I walk at work. It doesn't really make me happy. It makes me happier when I arrive at the commercial part and there are more people around and there are a lot of activities and shops. It does nothing for me like walking in the neighborhoods. I noticed, I noticed that I had a lot of lethargy in my body, which is depression. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B I work really hard to go to sleep before midnight and I notice that it makes a big difference when I sleep enough. How are you when you don't sleep well? B I'm fine, I'm just tired, but I think I'm, you know, pretty well. In terms of energy in terms of interaction with other people. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B sspt? No. Diagnosed with depression? B yes. How long have you been diagnosed? B recently. What were your symptoms? B Lethargy, lack of joy, lack of community, lack of close ties, lack of support network, person to talk to, not much energy to do additional things that would help you improve your life. It's just in a way in the fight to simply spend the day, then try to find the energy to do something to improve it. Yes, I think I know what my global trigger, what is the global thing, but it is deeper than the global thing itself, if it makes sense. Well, me. You will think that I am full work, but honestly, I'm really not. I. I called my mother yesterday and I left her a message and at the end of the message, I said I love you. And it's a month she called me, which was my birthday. When she called me, I didn't answer, but she didn't say she loved me. The previous year, she didn't even called me on my birthday and she said she didn't feel good. And we had a fall in November. So I haven't talked to him since the fall. But essentially what I achieved in November W Like just a huge inability to love that she has towards me. And I think it's one thing for life. So I think it is difficult for me to get closer to people and create links with people because if you can't trust your mother, who can you trust? And if you have not received your mother's love and you don't really know how to receive love, in fact something about the reception of love or self -receipt or validation or something like that. I think that the lack of support throughout my life, whatever my ambitious or determined, there is really a underlying every day of sadness on this subject, not having a mother. And it is therefore I think, the main challenge of solving in my psyche, my soul or my emotions, something like that. How do you face them? B How can I face my emotions? Well, I sit with them alone mainly because there is no one to share the deepest with whom would really understand me. There is no long -term relationships, but I interact a lot with my emotions when I train my instrument during an actor. And it is therefore a great training emotionally. What made you ask for help? B a few months ago, I crossed a patch where I had no place to stay and I ended up staying with someone I thought I was a student friend. She turned out to be crazy and I had to leave there and, therefore, I had to ask for advice according to my school's mandate. It was the incident that sparked it. Are you going to always in therapy now? B yes. A good. Do you think therapy is expected? The therapy B is useful. It is a reflective experience. So you think throughout the week before you see your therapist. And then you somehow start to think of a deeper level on a theme, a current theme that looks like what is the problem? And then it is very impatient to have someone to talk to can really listen to.

"A belly. She looks more human than some of the therapists I had. Really interesting. I mean, I think that's the point. She was much more compassionate. Oh, haven't you spoken with her yet? Okay, so I'm going to put this here. Do I look up up there? You just look at Ellie. The way this retraction works is that you speak. He's going behind your ears like that. So she will ask you a series of questions and then you can answer as you wish. And when she sends, she should say goodbye. But if she, for any reason, stops for 10 to 15 seconds, something may have been wrong. And so in any of these cases, press the button. B well. A good, so I'm going to start. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was crowded to talk to people and a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B Well, I guess. Where are you from? B well, I was born in Philadelphia, but we lived everywhere. So I'm not philadelphia, I was just born there and I lived there for a year. A good. What are the things you really like? B I like time. People are generally more sympathetic than where I lived on the east coast. The landscape, the environment, the beach, the mountains, the cycle paths and the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables. What are the things you don't really like at it? B the usual. Traffic, I suppose that some of the people in the entertainment sector, a little of materialism and, you know, when you meet as said stereotypical. R I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? B I used to do when I had a life. I went to 41 countries and really enjoyed it. I would like to be able to do it again one day. What do you like in travel? B I guess since I am from nowhere, it's fun to go somewhere where you don't have to integrate. You are already weird, so it doesn't matter if you're not there. And I really like to meet people of different cultures. I love to see new environments. I love to see historical things or, you know, just things of incredible beauty. I love to meet different types of people. Food. I love different food. Thus, all the foods of all foreign lands are always fun. And the other thing that I secretly like that I There are no wrap too much, it is that you can escape completely and completely and forget your real life. A I would like to hear about one of your trips. B Very well, let me think a minute. Gee, I don't know which one to choose. I guess I try to think in my head. I probably shouldn't think too much. I try to think, do I choose a horrible to give you more emotion or do I choose a normal? Although I am not so sure. My traveling companion was my husband, you know, who, I don't know what his story is. I guess he's gay. So we went to. In Singapore and it was just fabulous. I. With the exception of the pieces that had to face him, I loved being there. You know, the variety of delicious and incredible food. I am a big fan of Curry Laksha, so it was really fun. It's a big shopping, so I wanted me to be a little younger because they had fabulous fashions. I liked the time because it was hot and scorching. It was really easy to get around things like that. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B see. For any reason, I think of a bad. It's nothing, I guess you mean to travel. When I traveled through Vietnam and Cambodia, I had a very bad case of hemorrhagic fever. I was in Hoi. No, I was not. I was in it. I was in Huy. Sorry, in Vietnam. And I was horribly ill and I light up and my traveling companion, husband, me. I said, go take water. I was, you know, really sweating abundantly and I was very sick for a while. And he went out to take the water, I don't know, in the morning. And he came back to, I don't know, 7 a.m. or something and said he did it. A guy on a motorcycle said, let me take you somewhere where you can get water. And I don't know what he did all day. So I think back at the time and remember to have entered and came out of consciousness and thought, I will die here. And I was wondering if I would never be, you know, found in this hotel that we were staying. So I don't know, I survived. And I probably surprise it, but it was simply memorable because I often think back when I see sick people or something else and I think, gee, why did I know I survived? This is not my SSPT thing. But if you are wondering. What did you study at school? B I studied the film as the first cycle while I was starting to dance. And then I realized that I was not really so talented. I mean I'm going well, but not really so good. So I went to the movie And I really enjoyed it. And then later in life, I went back to school and I became a lawyer. What are you doing now? B I am an underemployed lawyer. I guess I was thrown with a lot of people. You know, I now understand why the, how do you call it, the laws on age discrimination come into play after 40 years. Well, you know, it is extremely difficult to rehthe. So now, I have a few customers, I do a few money, you know, would prefer to be fully used. Not really so well. This is why I am here today to make my 35 meager dollars because after having paid all these loans and everything for the law faculty, because I had stupidly chose one of the most expensive law faculties in the country. So, each of you who listens, don't do that. I mean, do not choose an expensive superior school if you do not get financial assistance and you do not have the financial assistance of your family. So, anyway, because I have spent all my life paying my first cycle and my higher education, I now find myself looking at the barrel of long -term unemployment and retirement and not having, you know, insurance or enough for what they say that we are supposed to live in the future. Well, what is your dream work? B I don't even know. I don't do it, I don't have any dreams left. When I was younger, my dream work was to be an ambassador because I thought it would be so fun, you know, to have contacts with different countries and to make themselves friendly and to meet people all the time and to represent your country positively. I don't know, I don't think I have dreams left. I'm too old. I have nothing more than the world wants. Do you consider yourself more shy or out? B well, I have always been extremely out and friendly until perhaps, I don't know, five years ago. And then me, I suppose that I am always friendly and outgoing. I just do, sometimes I give up and I don't even try anymore. One why? B well, it's embarrassing when people say, what do you do to say that you are unemployed? Because people think, I had so many people say, well why don't you just get out and get a job? Or they assume you are lazy or something like that. Where it is like, okay, assholes. I have been working since I was 12 years old. You know, I did not have fun at university. I worked three jobs to pay for all this. And my loans, I don't know. I guess I just stopped trying because. And I am a little embarrassed by my situation. You know, I quote a married one to someone who has this secret life. I'm not k Now what is its story. I suppose that I am embarrassed that my life is, you know, roughly a complete and total failure of each objective that I had. A on your relationship with your family. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I do a bike ride along the beautiful cycle path. I will swim on occasion. I'm going to drink, have a drink. I have a low alcohol tolerance, so essentially one or two will put more to delete me. I don't know. I used to do yoga and stuff like that. Nowadays, I try to make a deep breath. How are you going to control your temperament? B It depends on who is the person in a normal situation with normal people or with full foreigners, I am damn good in this area. With two people, I am no longer good at all. My husband and mother, because they were both extremely violent physically and emotionally. And I finally learned recently, in about the past few years, approximately, that's what I accepted as normal was not normal. So I did all the assertion where you say, it is not, you know, please do not lie to me, nor whatever they did. And, you know, the person is supposed to say, oh, I did not know that it hurt you. Let me change. But of course, it never really works in real life. So now I find that if I have to have contact with these people, what I am one of them, I have to do it. I am extremely, you know, if they lie to me, I'm just fed up and, you know, face them. GOOD. Well, can you give me a chance? I guess it was my husband because I pay the mobile phone bill and he's family level. It turned out that he had 44 pages of text when he left for this secret trip to a summer camp. Do not ask. I don't even want to think about it. I don't know who these people are with whom he sends SMS. So I asked him what F. are you. These texts. Who are you doing this with? And I tried to call some of the figures, and people would hang on me. So, you know, my imagination started to think, what is he doing in this summer camp? Why do people he sends SMS and send SMS not to answer? Do you know, draw your own conclusions? So you know, and he didn't answer me, and he continued to lie in these emails of a sentence he sent back. So me, you know, I started to put these threats and the emails, like, oh, yeah, well, if you don't tell me, I will call This number and find out who they were. What he wouldn't answer me. And then me. As I said, I called, and them. They would hang me up. So who knows who these people were? To tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B well, I mean, there are general lives, like, I would have liked never to marry this person. A situation that I would have liked to manage differently. I guess I had a job. I was in fact chief lawyer of a business. You will probably not believe it. Now, you who are there, and the president started to do all these things that were ethical badly and to go against my advice, and I should have taken out Hades from there. I should have stopped immediately, but I still paid, you know, $ 200,000 in student loans, but I should have left there. R which you feel guilty? B UM, Gee Willikers. Well, I guess. The only real thing I feel guilty is something that I would prefer not to discuss on a band. I mean, I had enough cries tell me over the years that I was justified. The most difficult decision I have ever taken. I don't know. I mean, each stupid. Many decisions have been difficult. The most difficult, I have no idea. In Tell Me on Neved or something you want to be able to erase from your memory. B for the past 49 years. I guess I could erase my big SSPT. When I was 18, a serial killer removed me and I escaped it. I. Did you already serve in the army? B No, I didn't do it. How have you been feeling lately? B I don't know. You know, it was long. By telling me more about it. B I don't know. Just here or there. I am more numb. I don't care. I'm just waiting, you know, to die. R Have you noticed these latest changes in your behavior or your thoughts? B well, I had a bad blow last week with something, and I just had no appetite like, I don't know, five days. And what is horrible is that I haven't lost a single book. I don't know. Can you tell me? B see. I was not hungry, so I did not eat and it did not seem to affect my body at all. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B well, I seem to have developed a horrible neck pain and it made things doubly difficult. The second thing is that me, because I am still prey to these horrible nightmares, these are in fact only real events that really happened to replay again and again. I am addicted to the Internet and I am just p Ut stuff on youtube or anything all night. And you know, I often have a strong and noisy sound, so I don't sleep as well and I have a horrible and horrible bed at the moment and I live in a very noisy place. Why do I live in a noisy place? Because I was unemployed, as I said or underestimated, as I told you, and I have no money to live in a place that should be equal to all the hard work I have done in my life. How are you when you don't sleep well? B You look at it, you know, as everyone would be. I don't feel so well. I'm tired. I. I don't know, just tired. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B Yes, a few people I met told me that I had. How long have you been diagnosed the first time for the first time? I don't know, maybe 15 years. Recurring nightmares,. I don't know, I developed anxiety and I panic, you know, if I think I'm going to lack gas. I'm breathtaking and. I don't know, at the bottom. I used to manage anything. Now something stupid is happening and I catastrophy and I think it's going to be horrible. So I have to talk to it. Oh, I lost all the ability to trust and I am numb by all feelings. Forgive me? Oh, well, I don't know what you said. Can you tell me? B well, you, you know, I think my SSPT, I was fine and I had it. After the 18 -year -old incident, I did well and Dandy. And then something happened. In the past decade, I had just struck after the blow after the blow and it brought everything back and. Or maybe it is because I am no longer so busy. So I have time to ruminate all these horrible things. And I have. This is a delayed thing. I'm much worse now that I was not afterwards, you know, escape from a serial killer. I mean, it's a kind of pain in the neck. Oh, literally. How do you face them? B If I am not in good health, I go, you know, drink a few things of alcohol, which I don't know, I don't know, something is wrong with my heart. They said to me and therefore more, you know, even if I have a single one causes a lot of pain and stuff, or I try to do things to relax or, you know, if I have a very, really bad day, I could, I could hit myself or injure myself in another way. Because after you, after doing this, he frees everything, you know, you are all panicked. And then if you hurt yourself, you are really distracted, as, you know, it really hurts. And then you don't really think about the horrible thing in your head. You ""Thinking, I have this pain. What made you ask for help? B I don't know. I tried to get help. I can't get help now. I have no insurance. I can't. I am not poor enough. I would need to follow all my retirement savings and be without the penny to get free help. So I mean, I would like to be a normal person again and I would like to be happy. I would like to be a functional human, you know, as I was. No, I have no money and no one cares, you know, middle class people with average income. Do do you feel useful therapy? B You know, I went to a Gazillion Therap. Not a gas, but, you know, I don't know, 15 therapists maybe during my 30 years or anything. Sometimes you get someone who is good. And I found that the younger the person, the better it is like a couple. When I was at the Faculty of Law, I went to see someone or when my father died when I was 18, right. At the same time, this other thing happened, I saw students. They were actually the best. The worst seem to be those who are as in my age category or more, because they are somehow verified and they just want someone who is there. But in terms of similar, I don't know, I did this EMD, whatever it was called once and did not really work. Sometimes you get a nougat. As a therapist told me, you don't want to kill yourself. You just want a different life. So when I'm suicidal, I just think about it. I don't want to kill myself. I just want a different life. So sometimes you get a nougat, but you generally know it hasn't really saved me yet. By telling me more about it. B do I have? I just did it. Sometimes you get a good therapist. Oh. One thing I have learned is that most therapists are actually more screwed up than me. You know, I can seem to fuck you here, but you know, at least me. I could work. I had a little success and I. I never injured people intentionally. I don't live people. I am not dishonest in my work. I am a compassionate. And I found so many therapists. You know, they live their adorable little life in the suburbs or wherever they come, and they are completely unable to relate to everything that is outside their world. What kind of changes have you noticed since you go to therapy? B Well, I haven't been, as I told you. So when I went, I noticed that it was fun to go somewhere once a week and that someone listens to your misfortune stories. Al Although sometimes became frustrating if the person was not useful. A MM. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? B really happy? Um. I tried to cultivate it. So, last night, I was on the cycle path, and I looked around the things of beautiful nature around me, and there were briefs for a few seconds when I had it. And then, you know, an aggressive cyclist or someone else would come and it would be destroyed. But if not, more maybe a brief second or a few seconds, I don't even know. I don't even know. Oh, me, that's good. Oh my God. Do you even listen? I don't think you listened to very carefully. You are like some of the shrinks I have. People. Is that what you wanted me to tell you? I. I don't even know what was the question anymore, to tell you the truth. Sorry. Oh no. Is it the empty silence that I am supposed to fill to answer? Where are you? What was the question? I don't know. Sometimes therapy is useful. Sometimes this is not the case. Oh, happiness. It was the question. Sometimes I was happy. My happiest moment was when I went up inside the Great Pyramid of Giza. It was extremely. I don't know. It was just a wonderful and wonderful feeling. I am a claustrophobic, so I was proud to have succeeded through there, and it was just an incredible view. Gosh. Is it a test to see how we react when there is uncomfortable silence? Am I supposed to press the button so that the person between now? Good morning. Very well, she stopped talking.

"R and she is always a woman. It's funny. B She will ask you a series of questions, then when she has finished, she will make you know and press this button to let me know. A good. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? A yes. B ok. So how are you today? R I'm fine, thank you. I was born in East Los Angeles. And yes, the freedom to explore outside with a different weather temperature, you know, over time, temperature and climates. Ski or at the beach, maybe the same day. I like that. B What are the things you don't really like at it? R I probably think that overcrowding and smog. B I see what you mean. I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? A step frequently, but I did it. B What do you have to travel? A meeting with other people and learning their environment and their culture? Of course. The last trip I made outside of here was in Italy and it was the second time that I have been there. And I enjoyed it more this time because I knew what I wanted to see when I returned and. And I was better prepared for Italians and their culture. I felt that I was not, as you know, I was better prepared, I thought, for this trip. B What is one of your most memorable experiences? R who would be in the countryside and see a very small house in the middle of the hectares and hectares and acres of grapes was simply magnificent. B What have you studied at school? Human development. B How did you decided to do this? R I did not decide at the beginning to do it. I started at school with the intention of being a lactation consultant. And I went to a program in which you could graduate and get your license to become a lactation consultant. Thanks to the process, I learned that I had to do a long internship without salary. And I had a family, so I had to make a career choice quickly. And therefore the college offered human development as an adult. And I just went directly and I used my units that I had already acquired towards this particular major. And I'm happy with it. Currently, no, I stay at home. I have a little one. It is not so small. I prepare to go back to work in the meantime, I understand jewelry. B tell me abo Use your children. A well, I have three children. I am almost four years old and then I have two older children, 17 and 23 years old. B do you find it easy to be a parent? A no. b What is the best thing to be a parent? R that your children, love on their part and for them are unconditional. All the steps they go through, there are stages all the time for each age. And everyone in my household is different because they are different ages. B What are the ways that you are different as a parent than your parents? R I think I'm probably more in tune with these different stages. That's why it drives me crazy. And I think my parents, the moment when my parents were parents, was a bit like, you know, is she nourished, is she dressed? She has a house, I mean, a roof above her head. And we are going very well as parents and we love it. And so there was not too many things I felt that parents thought in terms of parenting in this way. Like today, you know, there are books for each age, every year, you know, and therefore I think that it differs considerably in this way. B How far are you from your family? A very close. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? An outgoing, why? I don't know. I don't feel inhibited. I feel, you know, entrusting to people. I probably speak more than I need. B Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? A pearl i. I do. I understand jewelry. This is what I do to relax. B it's great. How are you going to control your temperament? A I am pretty good. I. Well, I think I try not to do it. Do not feel or let others know what my emotions are when I am upset, which is not good because if I do nothing with them, then I know that at some point, it will come out. And, yes, it is something on which they have to work, like exercising or something. It was my husband and it was roughly. He asked me if I had thought of ever cheating in our wedding on him. Really tired of talking about this same subject. B Can you tell me? A well, he came. It generated a customer of my husband who is a woman, and she shared with him that she had deceived her husband for a year because she wanted her for many things. And. And so he took this information and came home and decided to ask me if I thought about it and what made me think of cheating. And he knows I felt him. And it made me feel, did this my I want to cheat or have I thought of cheating? And we had this conversation often. And I mean, not only that, but I don't know just about cheating in general. And so I just said what I am normally. Normally, it is that I did not cheat and that I thought about it when we were for the first time together, but it was just a simple thought. And. And then his answer was, I know that if we are wrong, we never talk about each other. And it's a bit, I suppose, irritated me. I was really embarrassed by that. And I just started thinking, you know, we still have this conversation. And why do we have this conversation? Are you the one who cheats? And that's how it had entered this argument. I mean, it was in a. Cries. I mean, it was partly a conversation and texts in part, not at all. B tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. A practice almost any situation that involves my children. And if I shouted, because I really don't like it, if I came to the point where I had. Where I shouted, it bothers me because I had shouted a lot, and I just feel bad about it. And I really try not to manage a situation that implies my children, no matter how it could be upset and cause cries. B Okay, tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. R would probably be to keep a pregnancy or not. B Can you tell me? Yeah, yeah, me. I was just talking about it yesterday, in fact, and I was pregnant and I wanted. I was not yet married and I wanted to be married, but I did not think it was the right time for me. And I had roughly decided that I was not going to keep this pregnancy, but I made the decision by myself. And when my partner discovered that I was pregnant, he said he wanted to have a child very much and wanted to marry me. And so this decision was quite difficult because I felt forced to do it and I felt super guilty of not. And I hope it is correctly. Hang on, this earpiece falls. We go there. It was probably the most difficult decision. In fact, what do you know? No, I wouldn’t say that it is the most difficult decision I have ever had to take. I'm sorry. The most difficult decision I had to make in my life was whether the hospital should or not disconnect the life machine for my father or not. It was the most difficult decision. B What has decided to do this? R because I knew that the quality of life he wanted He himself was more than that. And having been to use the situation in which he was, not able to do anything either. Talking about him was beyond whom he was. And I couldn't see him anymore. And it would be a vegetable, I was told. So I agreed to use it almost never. Too many things that I lack spirit and especially especially the weekend because my older children went out with their friends. Even if I know they're going to come. I mean, I am constantly worried about the way they are when they come home. And so you really can't sleep on weekends most of the time. But sometimes it's not so many days not to sleep a good night. I'm just exhausted. I vanished. But it's hard, very stressed. B Can you tell me? A my son was faced with certain legal problems and is currently incarcerated. And it was really difficult. B Have you noticed these changes in your behavior or your thoughts lately? A yes. I was probably very short, in a bad mood, irritable. Are B triggered by something? A well, I often think of many things that don't even happen. My mind goes from 1 point to point B and I don't even know how I got there. You know, it's interesting. Yeah. B Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? A number B Have you received a diagnosis of depression? A yes. B For how long have you been diagnosed? A about three years ago. B What made you ask for help? A My Obg suggested that I see a psychiatrist. B you are still going to therapy now? A yes. B What kind of changes have you noticed since you follow therapy? A well, I have changing therapist. It is therefore. Because the program I was in lost funding and I lost my therapist or the therapist I worked with. And so it's been about two months, maybe three now. But I noticed when I was in therapy that it was just a complex part of my life, my week to see my therapist. It really helped me to face. B is good. It's good. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. R When I picked up my son from his prison release or to get her. Probably, you know, she would use the term hustler, but which means I'm going. I am not afraid to do a lot of different types of jobs to do what I need to do to support my family. I mean, you know, legally, of course. Outgoing. Maybe sometimes a little too out for her. And compassionate, sensitive, loyal. B What are the things you want you to change about yourself ? To all the things that remind me of my mother. B like what? A well, screaming. The howling part was one. Just the little things that made me so crazy. I can see myself doing them and it bothers me a lot. Regarding what? B everything that comes to mind. Too much, really. I don't know. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To go to university just after high school. Not wait. And that I didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy. Or that you don't need to be in relation to being happy. That you can certainly succeed and not in a relationship and always be happy and live life. B tell me about something that you recently did that you really enjoyed. What did I do? A I visited my son yesterday. And it was really good. Yeah. B How did you feel at that time? R I was happy that he is safe. B What are you the most proud in your life? To my children and my achievements at school and at work. B it's great. Okay, I think I asked every question. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. A bye. Part of part, tilted behind.

"A good, great. So now I'm going to ring you. When it will take place, it will let you know. You can press this button to let me know. B ok? RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. A it's good. Where do you come from? B I'm from Greenwich, Connecticut. A really? B yes. When did you move to the? B I moved here in 2008, so about five years ago. How often do you go back to your hometown? B I try to return at least once a year. Sometimes I go more, sometimes less. How does he compare himself to the whole? I think I like where I am better than it in general. I think that apart from the fact that it is somewhere, I know the type of people who are there more my type and what I am used to, and it is less superficial. R I understand. Why did you move to the? B I moved here for the university after obtaining my graduate diploma, and my mother and sister live in California. How is you easy to get used to living in Los Angeles? B at first, it was easy because I felt like it was a new experience. So you adapt and that you live everything at the same time. But after the first years, when he really settled, how different it is and what life is here, it has become more difficult than at the origin. What did you study at school? B fine arts and photography. Who seems interesting. How did you decided to do this? B I was interested in photography from high school. I did a lot of programs and I got awards and things like that, and shows. So I decided to continue art. Do you still work in there? B Yes, I have a diploma in fine arts that I obtained last year. A great. Are you happy that you did that? B Yeah, I really like to work or intervene in legal medicine. I better like that than at the start. What I wanted to do is independent photography. I have the impression that it is a safer work and it is very interesting. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B UM, this is an interesting question. I guess my childhood in general, growing up. Can you tell me? B um, well, my family is very close, my family also expanded. And they all. Most of them live in the region or on the east coast. In general. So we always had big family parties and things for public holidays and religious ends and things like that. R that looks like an excellent situation. B Yeah, it's really fun. And we try to come together as much as possible, which is more difficult now because everyone is distributed among the different states and countries. Do you consider yourself more shy or out? B I consider myself more shy. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I watch reality TV. I think it's a bit funny and light. One like what? B I look at Bravo TV, like the Real Housewives Shows and just like funny things you don't really need to be careful. How are you going to control your temperament? B um, I'm fine, I guess. I don't really have a temperament if I have. If I am more stressed, it is definitely seen in my attitude, but I don't really have the anger. At uh huh. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B well, me and my boyfriend as a bicker all the time. Just like about insignificant things. But other than that. I had an argument with my father a few days ago. Can you tell me? B There have been tensions since I went to visit during the holidays last winter. Things about his girlfriend and he thinks I should be me to make a kind of effort to have a relationship with her. Although he doesn't think so for any reason, it should go both ways. So, like the 30th time, it. We were on the phone and he told me how I had to call him and tell him and I told him that I was going to do it this last weekend because of the Jewish holidays and, and he was somehow as very immature and saying to me, oh, forget, she does not want to have your news now. And a bit like I was less careful because I don't care to have a relationship with her. So, if she doesn't want to hear my news, you know, it's easier for me. Yeah, it sucks. Tell me about a situation you want you to manage differently. B I mean, every time, I mean it was the same recurring argument a lot. And I want me to be able. Sometimes I do it. But I want the moments when it turns into an explosive fight that I could just bite my tongue. But the fact is that it says certain false things. Or things he knows that the Ike, will check me, who is really mean and that he should not tell me. So him. So, I just like to lose it and I can't really say nothing. Yeah, I'm sorry. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to make. Um. B well, I guess the most difficult decision I made, what me. This is not the case. I only realize that it is the most difficult decision, as looking back, is once you decide where after getting your secondary school diploma, where to go to university. Because for me, I essentially changed all my life and moved away and I did all this by myself. So that did not seem to be a difficult decision at the time. It was like an progression of the next step. But looking back now, this is probably one of the most difficult decisions I made. A good, tell me about an event or something you want to be able to erase from your memory. B um, well, I would like to be able to erase the event or see my grandmother's funeral, which, obviously, would change nothing, but that did not see it. There was not something I would like to love, to have in my memory. One yeah. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B she was. It was a very positive influence and has still not been critical. And now I mean, my parents are excellent models, just in general. I mean, they are very successful people. So whether or not we have disagreements or we are separate people, they are sort of good models. In terms of what you want to have when you are older, as it is easy. Do you have a good sleep night? B usually, it's easy. The problem is to stay asleep. No matter how much I go to bed, whether at 10 p.m. or 4:00 a.m., I will be standing like watchmaking at 7:30 am or 8:00 am. The last one every day. And I can't understand why I can't stay asleep any longer. Are they triggered by something? B No, I'm just. In the morning, I guess I'm a lighter sleeper, but I wake up. Since I can't stay asleep anymore. What had never been a problem, this coherent, but now is the case. I don't remember the last time I slept after 8:30 am. How are you when you don't sleep well? B I mean, it's just. If I have to do things during the day, it makes things much more tiring, but it is not really the case. I'm so used to it now, it doesn't really change my mood. It's part of everyday. A good. How do you feel recently? B I don't know, I feel very like very. So, so just no high extremes, no lower extremes. It's a bit of a note, bland. A Have you, have you noticed changes in your behavior or your thoughts lately? B I mean, nothing like recently, as recently. It's just that I would say over a period of time that I have somehow gradually become more secret and just reserved and not very outgoing. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. I received an anxiety diagnosis. What made you ask for help? B I had breathing problems for a day or two and I had to go to the hospital because I thought it was more serious because I could not breathe. But they said it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety. Do you have the impression that therapy is useful? B I think in the right setting and with the person who does it, if they are open -minded and the therapist is useful and good in what they do, then yes. Are you going to always in therapy now? B No, I haven't been in therapy since I was a child. Why did you stop? B I went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to love to face the problems they had with me. But this was never the case. I mean, we sat down and talked about my day. I didn't feel like I needed therapy at the time, so I didn't really get a lot. R I see what you mean. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B eh well, I was happy when I was back home with my boyfriend with his family during the New Year's holidays. When I'm there, I can always just. We save our money, so it's a complete vacation. I don't have to worry about payment of invoices. I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow, with whom I have to face. I'm coming. Every morning, we wake up, we drag, take advantage of the day. A it's great. Is there anything you regret? B in general? A yes. B I regret the college where I chose to go, I did not do it. Being from the east coast, the entire college system is set up very differently. And the university is not the same as the Californian school system in tight knitting here. So when I was doing research on colleges, I thought in a way that the Santa Monica College was only a general college, just like the Boston College at home or, you know, any other school with the name of the college at the end. I did not realize until, you know, the end of my first year. Even that it looked more like a transfer school. As if I didn't even know you couldn't get a baccalaureate from there when I went. It therefore created more problems for me. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Good , since I am 22 years old, I would probably say 10 years ago, I would probably give myself the advice to stay closer to my home and have really pursued other options rather than being completely invested in the move to California. How would your best friend describe you? B UM, my best friend would describe me as a large charismatic, funny, outgoing and socially pleasant person. Which is different from how people who are not my good friends would describe me, what I mean, no. I mean, that's what it is. I am very out of the way and have a good time when I am with my friends in my element, but around foreigners and in uncomfortable groups and things. I'm just, I'm very shy and I don't really talk much. At uh huh. Tell me about something you have done recently that you really enjoyed. B recently. My friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball match a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed it. A beautiful. B yeah. Do you know that you are some of your best qualities? B I am very attentive. I am a very good judge of character, which, I mean, I suppose, I mean, I consider that it is a quality for me. I am very. I mean, I am not very affectionate. I'm more. I mean, I guess, I guess yes. A good. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. B Thank you. About your experience I can discuss.

"A All right. Okay, that looks good to me. So if you want to wave your hands around just a little bit, make sure the connect will pick up your body. B There we go. A Okay. Looks good. Oh, actually before that, one thing I almost forgot. I have to do something that sinks our equipment. There we go. B All right. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm alright. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B Los Angeles, California. A Really? B Yep. A What are some things you really like about la? B The lights, big city, it's always something going on. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B The traffic and that's it. A Okay. What do you study at school? B Business administration and business management. Not that I'm doing something else. I'm doing networking at the moment. A What's your dream job? B Hmm. To open up a big clothing line and just supply the whole world with clothing. A That sounds interesting. B Yeah, definitely. A Why? B Because I'm all about myself. It's all about me. A Do you feel that way often? B Not often, but more times than not, yeah. A What are some things that make you really mad? B Being lied to. And I guess people think you're dumber than what you are. Trying to get away from everything. Going to my own space very well. I'm great at controlling my temper. Probably like two days ago and it was probably just over some sports. It wasn't a real argument. Not a lot, but I travel enough. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Just being able to get a change of pace. See somebody new, see new faces, new environment. Let me see. Last trip I had was Vegas. You know how Vegas goes. It was pretty, pretty fun. It was a lot of. A lot of drinking and a lot of partying going on. Pretty open minded. I'm kind to pretty much everybody. I'm a pretty even kill guy. It's alright. It could be better. A Do you have roommates? B No. A That's good. Have you ever served in the military? B No, ma'am. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Nope. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Lately it's been pretty tough, I guess because I've been staying up so late. But that's my fault. I don't know. I guess I'm a night owl. All of a sudden I'm turning into an owl. A Okay. What are you like when you don't sleep well? B Sluggish and tired all day. If I don't sleep well all day, I'm just laying around. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B No, not too much. A Okay. Is there anything you regret? B No. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Stay focused and listen to the adults. A Could you have done anything to avoid it? B Yeah, tell me more about that. I mean self explanatory. I could have just listened to parents or other adults that try to steer you in the right way. And you know, you're being a stubborn kid at those ages. So it's like, what? What are you talking about? This is my life. I can do what I want. I don't have to listen to you. But now I see that what they were telling me was correct. A How would your best friend describe you? B Hilarious. A Okay, how close are you to your family? B Pretty close. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Both my parents, mother and father. A That's great. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Recently. What did I do? New Year's Eve party. I had the time of my life. It was so fun. A I'd love to hear all about it. B This New Year's Eve I went to a party at a friend's house in Baldwin Hills area. He had it at a pretty nice house. It's a three story house and it was like 350 people in there. It was pretty fun. But it was also not that fun because it was so many people and you couldn't really move. So that was the only downfall. But besides that, I brought my New Year in great with tons of friends and that's how it's supposed to be done. A Awesome. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? B I'm generally in a good mood every day. I mean, waking up puts me in a good mood. I guess you could say that, but I don't know. A good meal. A That's so good to hear. What's one of your most memorable experiences? B One of my most memorable experiences were probably when I was younger. I was in boy Scouts and we used to go camping all the time. And one year we went to Yellowstone or Yosemite, one of those places. And we had to work on a mountain biking merit badge. And of course, being from the city, I'm like mountain biking. I can ride a mountain bike. But once we got into the real mountains and got on real mountain bikes, I gained a new respect for the mountain bikers. It was pretty. It was fun and pretty intense. Going downhill, doing about 45 miles an hour in dirt on a bicycle was pre pretty intense. I'll never forget that. A What are you most proud of in your life? B I don't know. That's a tough one to answer. What am I most proud of? I don't know. Honestly. A Okay. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.

Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And don't hesitate to tell me all your age. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? A yes. B ok. So how are you today? A I am fine. B is good. Where do you come from? A I am from Los Angeles and born in Los Angeles. B really? A yes. B What are the things you really like at the? At you have a lot of places to go, a lot of people to see, a lot to do. B What are the things you don't really like in the lake? A smog. The environment has changed over the years. I have been there since 1952, and I had been born here in Los Angeles, and I see such changes with regard to the environment with SMOG and it is essentially. B I see what you mean. I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? R I have been several places in the United States, yes. B What do you have to travel? A different type of test of kitchens. I like to go to the museum, as a history. I am a historic buff. Go to a different place from where. I am here all my life. B I would love to hear about one of your trips. Let me start. Try Boston. I had never been to Boston before. And when I went, I was able to look at the history of the buildings and I went. I saw Lake Charles and the boats and all that. It was right. It was a good experience. There is another place where I went. I took a ferry and my mind went white on it. God, I can't even think about it for the moment. But other than that, New Orleans. I went to New Orleans. I did not go to Mardi Gras. I don't like going to Mardi Gras when they have a lot of people. I just went out out of season. I enjoyed it. I went to Atlanta, Georgia, and I made a cruise. I went to the Caribbean, I made the cruise in Mexico. My next cruise that I would like to go is Alaska because I want to be able to see certain areas that we have not yet destroyed. Regarding the environment. B you consider yourself more shy or more Going? A I am out. Regarding places, I have no problem to eat alone. I have no problem meeting people. I am not shy to converse back and forth in a stranger. B Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? R I have a favorite thing. I like to go on the internet and I like to make sweet steaks. I am a person who likes to try to participate in many competitions and I have been very successful since I was a child. I have won a lot of contests and in the evening, I find an hour of time and I go just online and just. I am so good in this area. I know exactly the right time to even enter. I generally try to enter it before midnight when everyone sleeps. So it managed to get married and have my children. B tell me about your children. A I have a 27 -year -old son and I have a 31 year old son. Both, well, one of them is married and the other is not. And I haven't become a grandmother too long. So I have a grandson and my son, he works for the County of Los Angeles as a real estate transporter and the other is a computer engineer. And I have been married for 33 years and fundamentally, my marriage is quite strong. B It's so good to hear. Do you find it easy to be a parent? R You know if you build a foundation with your children and have a good relationship with them and talk to them and discover what is happening and tell them that you love them. My son, I taught them all the time when they came out, I love you. And even today, when they call me and hang up, they say, mom, I love you. You should always give them this good feeling when they leave the door you care. And I never had to go to prison to get them out. They were quite obedient. I mean, the boys will be boys, but I have never had a problem with regard to serious trouble and I am very proud of it, especially boys. I don't know how it would have been with the girls. It may have been a little different. But the boys, I must say that they were quite obedient and they respect the law. B What is the best thing to be a parent? A better thing is to look at them growing up and becoming parents themselves and seeing what they essentially learn from you. And I look at my son, as I said, just a recent grandmother, and I look at him, how he manages his son. And it seemed that he had learned a lot from his foundation that he learned Ed at home on how to manage his son, to be responsible, to go to work every day. And he knows that, hey, I have a woman, I have a son, and it is my job to make sure that I keep a roof over their heads so that it is paying. And fundamentally, he treats it well. My mother was stricter about me. My parents, for an unknown reason, I suppose that because my sister and I are the girls, they were not strict on the boys, but they were more strict on girls. So they didn't let us go in many places. And then my parents too, they don't type that it liked to travel. And I used to look at them and say no, I'm not going to be like them. I'll travel. I'm not going to stay at home. I mean, there is nothing wrong with them because they found love at home and did things at home, but they never really traveled anywhere. And my mother used. She was afraid of planes, for one. And I used to try to talk to her and get on a plane and go somewhere and she said, oh, I'm going to go here, I'm going to go. But she never did it. She died. She never had a problem. So I caught up. And I want to do something different, and it's to travel more than and be more there. I was no longer a social butterfly. My mother was not a social butterfly. So I compensated him. I think before speaking. And I am also a type of person too, I take the feelings of others before chasing the bad thing. I try first to analyze the situation because sometimes you can open your mouth too early, soon and you can put yourself in something you may not be able to get rid of. B when will you go back the last time you argue with someone? What was it? R This is probably something about my husband. Oh, I know what it was. That's about it. Well, probably on a new construction on which my husband is working on our house. We had a disagreement about it. Men have their own way of doing things. And I told him not to use a certain person to work on our house. But because of the personal relationship he has with this person, he has continued and now he sees all the falls. And he didn't listen. And so I didn't say, I told you, but I guess he can say by my facial expression that he would have hurt. And I said to him, I said, look, you lose money. And it became a problem after another. So now, the construction thing is in the air at the moment because he knows he has hurt, but he doesn't want to face the fact. Well, he knows it, but he doesn't really want to face the fact. So he says, look , this is my project. No, this is our project. It is therefore one of the greatest arguments that we have at the moment that I can think that it is recent. I felt that he didn't really listen to me. And he looked more at a cheaper and economical way than he could do without going through good manners. Because I told him you have to do your research. I am the kind of person, I do my research before jumping in something. I try to poill my i and cross my T. But my husband, he is not like that. It is like, oh, I can get this person and do this project for the amount of money. And he's a good friend of mine. Well, I don't care. I mean, is it authorized? He doesn't look at it all. He jumps into it, which cost him additional money, the useless money he spent. And I mean, it was a lot of money. And so I was really very upset. Yes, it did. I was very upset about this because it was just a waste of the money that we could have saved because we end up redoing the same thing. And that didn't make sense. B tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. Differently. I got back early. I had the chance to retire at 50. I retired in 2002. I worked for the state of California as an analyst of disabled people. And what happened is that I could. The reason why I was able to retire so early because I have been working since I was 18, and I was, like, 31 and a half of service. And what was so well on this subject that I only had to invest, like 10 years in my health insurance, so I was able to obtain complete health insurance. But the only thing about it, when you retire, I was with Calper. And I don't know if you know Calper, but we have an excellent retirement system. And since I had been working with them for so long, I have not obtained the complete percentage. I should have stayed until the age of 55 but I went out at 50 and I did not get the total amount. But it's okay. I found myself returning by doing some part -time work for the economic reason. And then I united. So I think it was the kind of error I made. I should have wait until I was 55 and 50 years old. But I now look at it until health insurance. I really took advantage of the increase in health insurance costs increased and I don't. I pay very little money, so I think that too much cancels the money I receive. B tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. Let me see the hardest. It is probably when my mother died because I am not used to to anyone who dies. My mother died in 99 years of non -Hodgkin's lymphoma. And bringing together his funeral, my brother and my sister, we have never been confronted with anyone dying or gathering funeral. And the whole answer because I am the eldest, it was put to me and I am like Oh my God, what am I doing? And so I was a bit left there while trying to find his insurance policy because I had asked her to make sure that she was putting everything in order and that she never got there. So the most difficult thing was to go through your house and try to bring all things together and find things. You know, myself, I keep my business organized, but for an unknown reason, she had not organized hers. And I think it was the most difficult. And knowing how much I had to pay because I had to get out of my pocket on some of my things. And unfortunately my mom, it's interesting, she had a small barrel insurance, but she had a million dollars in accident insurance. And she is not dead of course. What accident? She had a medical condition. It was something. So we had to pay for the whole. Almost everything. Yeah, that was the case. But now I can manage. It will seem weird, but since I learned. So I made available to my children that my husband and I gathered and we end up obtaining our insurance policy. Not an insurance policy, but what are you calling for cannon insurance. We got it and just. We have had it for many years. It is therefore almost paid. But it's 10 years. They will pay for everything, the intrigue and everything. And another thing I did, I even wrote my own Own. I know it sounds weird. Then my son makes a phone call. That's it. I don't want them to go through what I have experienced. And my husband accepted. This is the only thing we agree on. And he said he didn't want someone to have a problem. People come and tell them what to do. It is already written. We made a living trust. I mean, it's nothing that they can do, but make a phone call and that's it. B How easy for you to have a good night's sleep? R I have no problem sleeping. I sleep very well. Very good. I am a little tired, but it is only because of the physical state. I discovered that I had a vitamin B deficiency and a vitamin D deficiency. It is therefore more physical but not mental. B How do you help with that? An exercise? To walk. Walk more. So, have you noticed changes in your baby? No, not really. B Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? A number B have you been diagnosed with Depression? A number B tells me about the last time you felt really happy. A I am fundamentally happy all the time. I am more so I make others happy. I receive more phone calls. People want an inspiration on things when they have projects on which they work. And I try to encourage them. And it makes me feel good when they hang up and say, you know, hey, I really appreciate your contribution. THANKS. And then they. I will follow them and see how they are. B It's so good to hear. How would your best friend describe you? A person oh, resource. I was described as a person of resource of my supervisor to my friends because I am the type of person, I am looking for everything. I arrive roughly. I do not dive into a situation. I try to search for information. I know that we have the technology here that you can get everything on the internet, but also go back to the old school. Like even finding this place. I mean, I made the card, Google, but also I like the Thomas brothers. I'm never going to abandon my yellow pages from the Thomas brothers' map. You would be surprised. I don't give up my yellow pages. So there are certain little things that I don't really let go. I know we have technology, but sometimes you know, you would be surprised that you can go around and find a lot of things that, even if the technology, you have a finger, but you can find things. And they say that I am more a resource person. Most people come to me just looking at things and I get this cum about it because I like to look for things and find it and it gives me satisfaction. I would like to be able to stuff. Going up and down on my weight, I will lose weight. I will follow this big diet before summer, then at Christmas, I have what they call a weight problem. And if I can stop doing bingle and making food, my friend, I think it's just a nervous disorder. I like to eat, but I don't like being overweight either because I have a lot of beautiful clothes at home and I can't get them right now. So I know myself. I'm going to go to this frenzy and try to lose weight for the summer so that I can get beautiful clothes. It is therefore not above all happier of my weight. That's it. Yeah. B is there something you regret? R I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. B is there something you regret? One no, not really. I regret and I can't stay thin. I can't lose. I mean, I can lose weight, but I regret not being able to keep it and fall back. Return the weight. B What advice would you like Give you 10 or 20 years ago? Let's see, 10 or 20 years ago, I would have saved a little more money before retiring and tidying up more money before retiring instead of retiring too early. The most proud of my life, meeting many people who came in my life. I have good friends. I still have 15 of the best friends I went to primary school. And very rare, you could find anyone to walk and say that they have the same group of 15 friends. We were in the sorority together, went to university together, we live in the same district and in fact, we have just done so. We all had our 60th anniversary and our high school group. We gathered a 60 -year anniversary meeting. And here, every 15, except one, we are all alive and healthy and we remain in contact. So I think it mainly keeps the same friends. I think we can probably overcome ourselves. All right. B Thank you for sharing your thoughts. You are welcome. Bye bye. All right.

What are the things you really don't like at it? C therefore spread. So difficult to get places. R I see what you mean. Is there anything else? What is your dream work? C my dream work? I don't think there is dream work for me. No, there is none. I am in a way unemployed right now. Me too. It's true. I studied town planning. Well, I think this school shooting thing and the nra seeming not wanting to move on this problem of control of firearms. That's it. I try to withdraw from this situation. It bothers me. Improved over the years. Most of the time, I try, you know, I go away or, you know, to control my emotions in terms of, you know, to move away. A it's good. What do you do to relax? It is enough to watch television. NOW. What is one of your most memorable experiences? C hmm. I would say that my children were born. By telling me more about it. Well, I have four children. Each birth was special and, you know, it was a unique experience each time. A it's great. Do you find it easy to be a parent? Well, it's much easier now because they are all adults. But, you know, it was difficult. What is the best thing to be a parent? C I would say, see your children grow up to be sweet Cessul and go beyond your expectations. What is the most difficult thing to be a parent? C you worry all the time. You worry about them. You know, now I am not as much around them, and I certainly worry about them. Who makes sense. When will it go up the last time it happened? C then I saw my children. Oh, about a week ago. I am generally quite happy when I see them. They all have an interest. Yeah. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? C my girlfriend. And? Insignificant. A good. Do you travel a lot? C no. Around the, perhaps, but that's about it.

Have you received a diagnosis of depression? C yes. How long lasts. C about a year. Recognizing that there were things in me. It was wrong. Did you think you had a problem before discovering it? I knew there was something that was not going because I was not myself. What were your symptoms? Well, you know, I was always tired and not excited by things and in a way lethargic, you know, I felt and not feeling. How have you been feeling lately? C almost the same thing. Are you going to always in therapy now? C yes, I do it, once a month. Do you feel like therapy? Yeah, I do it. I do. Can you tell me? That's well, it's. You know, it's. You know, I see a psychologist and we are talking about things. I don't really want to develop in detail, but you know, it's. It seems to me that it is useful. A change. Have you noticed since you have been in therapy? Well, I think it's a difficult question. Let's go, please. A good. How are you when you don't sleep well? C irritable? Eccentric. Who seems really difficult. Yeah, that is. R when is the last time you felt really happy? C oh, that's a good question. It's been a while. I would say a year and a half, maybe. Could you say a little more about it? It happens a lot in my life. You know, I just lost my parent, my father, my last parent. Just a lot of things in progress, so I'm going to leave that. Well, I still like sport. You know, watching a good match or something is usually putting me in a good mood, especially if my team wins. You know, I like USC. I have a nephew who is a first -year football player at the USC. And I’ve been a Trojan football fan for 40 years, so. Nice yeah. Do you know that you are some of your best qualities? Well, you know, I think I listen well and, you know, I am almost honest and simple. How would your best friend describe you? C This is a good question. I don't know. You should ask him. A good. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? C definitely my mother, but she died now. She has died for 10 years. But she has definitely had a positive influence all my life. No, I have a lot of regrets. Too many people to name a number. But, you know, it's. You know, you have the advantage of hindsight and. Yeah, I have a lot of regrets. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? C to listen to the elderly of my life. The people who cared about me. People whose only interest was to guide me in the right direction. A good. What are you most proud of in your life? C as I said, my children. I am very proud of them. A good. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.

"A complexion. B Okay, now I'm going to do this thing once again. So now I'm going to start virtual humans. She will chat with you a little. I'm going to put the doorbell here. When she was finished, she will let you know and you can hit the doorbell. All right? A good. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to start. Do you agree with that? A yes. B ok. How are you today? A very good. B is good. A New York. This has increased the volume a little. B oh, yes, of course. All right. I will wait here to make sure everything is fine. Has a change. It's good. I wanted to. I wanted to see what Los Angeles was. B How easy for you to get used to living in it? R probably took a year or two. B Can you tell me? A well, you know, to be far from my family, to be far from what I was used to in New York, in neighborhoods, people and I acclimatized to a whole new lifestyle. Here, time cannot beat the weather. It is generally always pleasant. It's not too hot, it's not too cold. It's creative. I like movies like the beach, traffic. There is a lot of traffic. Sometimes I think people are a little colder here. More distant and hostile than other places. B What have you studied at school? To I was of age in history. B Do you still work in there? A no. b what are you doing now? A I make demonstrations in high -end supermarkets. Be a screenwriter. This is one of the reasons why I came to Los Angeles. B How difficult is it? R is difficult because I do not always maintain concentration and motivation. I let other things distract me. B How did you decided to do this? R I am always interested in films, since I was a child. And I always wrote and I had an active imagination. B do you travel a lot? A in the last. Probably almost 10 years old, I have traveled more than in the past. Well, I have always traveled. Even when I was a child, my parents were traveling. So yes, see new places and see people different from me. See how they live and admire the views. I went to Kenya. It was probably one of the best trips I ever made. On the safari and go out in a jeep and see wild animals in their own natural habitat was quite incredible. B are you happy that you did that? A oh, yeah. He is one of the great ex- rich in my life. And I also arrived in a place in Egypt at the end of this trip called Sharm El Sheikh, which is just on the water. And he has some of the best scuba dives in the world, which is hard to believe that Egypt would do it. But it was simply incredible. I did not go underwater. I went into apnea. What should I do to relax? I like to listen to music. I like to help. Watching movies help me relax because it comes out of everything that could be in my mind. I meditate every day. I like to make walks in nature. It is always soothing, especially by the ocean. B is good. What do you do when you are annoyed? To this depends. Sometimes I get angry and I lose my composure. Often, I'm going to make a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself down, which I recently learned to do. It is very useful. And also since I meditate, I am not bored by things as easily as in the past. B What are the things that are really going crazy? To certain things that make me really crazy. I guess things think about injustice in the world or do people when it doesn't really need to be like that. That we could all hear ourselves and improve the world. Last night, I went to a film screening of an independent film and I did not think it had been very well done. It is not as long as we had a fun argument on the film. It was like, you know, it happened yesterday. So it was. It's in my mind. B ok. Is there anything you regret? Is there something I regret? Yeah. There have been opportunities in my life that I wanted to have taken them and have pursued them, some jobs, you know. When I arrived in Los Angeles, I had the opportunity to become a grip, and I should probably have continued this. B How did you decided to do this? How did I decided to do this? I don't really understand the questions. B Let's go back to this later. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To take advantage of every opportunity that came to me. I think that saying yes to any opportunity is very important. And no matter what you feel, you know, you must be convinced that you can do what you want to do. B Have you ever served in the army? A number B Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? A number B Have you received a diagnosis of depression? A no, but I was depressed in my life. B How have you been feeling lately? R For the most part, I feel good. Sometimes I feel a little blue. I think that sometimes if I allow a regret to come in my mind, it can bring me down. But I can usually get out fairly quickly. Are B triggered by something? A sometimes financial concern, sometimes an opportunity. How to explain it? The financier is a means that me. If I had made another decision, I could have more money or my life would be different. B Have you noticed changes in your behavior? A really step. I mean, I feel about the same thing. Which made me ask for help for. Let's go back to that. Well, generally talk to someone helped. When I did that. B is good. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? A fairly easy. I have no problem sleeping. What do you like when you don't sleep well? Usually I am grumpy. So, if I don't sleep well, you know, I feel tired and irritable. B I see what you mean. How would your best friend describe you? How would my best friend describe me? This is a good question. Well, I'm really nice and out. A little secret, probably I should be. They would like to see me more accomplished to achieve my goals and perhaps a little happier. B you consider yourself an introvert? Do you consider yourself introverted? R I think it's difficult. It depends. Sometimes I am very introverted because I like to write. So it takes means that I have to spend time alone. And then when I get out of that, I'm extroverted. So I don't really consider myself a difficult way or the other. It all depends on the situation and my mood. B would you say that some of your best qualities are? To my best qualities? I think. I think I care. I think I'm smart. I think I'm funny, I'm out. I have a nice personality. People have said that I am committed, but not oppressive or too engaging. In a way, there is a cool detachment and an intuitive creation. B Who is someone who has had a positive influence in your life? A yes. B ok. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? One last time I felt really happy, I don't know. I woke up this morning. I was quite happy. Have breakfast. I was happy. The sun was shining. B it's great. What is one of your most memorable experiences? R I think, as I said, going to Kenya was a memorable experience. I remember the scuba diving. Apnea diving was a great experience. I just remember having seen all the colors of the ocean and feeling the sun. Powerful sun. On my back. Almost beyond. Almost beyond man in a way. Just in contact with everything, the universe. B WOW, it seems to be an excellent situation. A yeah, it would be good to feel like that Every moment of the day, but. B I understand. What are you most proud of in your life? What am I the most proud of my life? I think I helped people and sometimes when they were in crisis, you know, I wrote scenarios, had good relationships. B can you give me an example of. A good relationship? Just, you know, be connected with someone else, you know, spend time with him and connect to emotional and physical and mental levels. B ok. All right. What are the things that you usually put in a good mood? R could be a song I hear on the radio. This could often be awaited impatiently something. You know, if I'm going to go to a movie, bowl, spend time with people. You know, watch the work and go to work and feel productive puts me in a good mood. B it's great. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. You are welcome. Bye. Bye. B Sometimes she asked me questions. A well, sometimes she asked me, as, it was going to somehow settle and then it asked me this question. And I said to myself, I don't really remember becoming specific like that. B OH, like, what do you remember what question you are talking about? A question on, like the search for therapy. Oh okay. One as, in a way, asked me, well, have you depressed? And I was like, well, sometimes you know, and then that will explain this. And then it was like, oh, and then it did something. And then it was like, well, you know, has the therapy helped?

RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. A it's good. Where do you come from? B California. What are the things you really like at? B I like time. I like people. What are the things you don't really like at it? B I don't like traffic. That's mainly that. R I see what you mean. What are you studying at school? B Sociology. A really? B yeah. How did you decided to do this? B This is a subject that interested me the most really. Of all the other subjects are. Do you still work in there? B no. What is your dream work? B to be a writer. Can you tell me? B I like to be able to write what I want to write. Right now, I'm writing things that don't really interest me, like articles on the culture of adolescents, things like that. What do you think of today's children? B I think they have it quite easy. They don't know how easy they have it. Yeah, I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B uh, no, not really. A good. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B depends on the situation or on whom I am. When I meet people for the first time, I can be shy. But if he's someone I have known for a while, I can be out. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I'm going to lie down or try a kind like deep breathing. Or maybe doing something that is rather fun and numb. Like watching television. TV? How are you going to control your temperament? B I'm pretty good. I don't really let anger show so much. I'm not like one. I have no fiery temperament or something like that. I am quite rational. A it's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B UM, I don't remember when the last time I argued with someone, because it's been so long. A wow. What are you wrong The culprit? B UM, I suppose that I feel guilty of the fact that I do not speak as much to my grandparents as I should. A good. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B UM, I'm close to my grandparents, but not really someone else in my family. One why? B because they have somehow raised me, and my parents were not really in the photo. This is as much as I understand. To tell me about a situation you want you to manage differently. B UM, I can't really think about it for the moment. A good. Tell me about an event or something you want you to erase from your memory. B uh, I guess when my sister died, it was really traumatic. A I am sorry. B mm. R is it uncomfortable for you to talk about it? B yeah. Yes. A good. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to make. B UM, this is the most difficult decision I have ever had to take is to decide to divorce my husband or not. What decided you to do this? B because we do not hear ourselves, and there was no reason to stay married, but I always felt like I had to hold it. How difficult? B I mean, it was difficult at the time, but I made the right decision, I think. A good. Who is someone who has had a positive influence in your. B My grandmother was a positive influence from a young age. Can you tell me? B, she is just a very strong character, powerful and in a way, and it was tested on me. A it's so good to hear. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B Not really super easy. I am sort of. I mean, it's probably my fault. I'm going to bed too late. How are you when you don't sleep well? B just somehow foggy and distracted. Having trouble concentrating. A good. How do you feel recently? B Do you mean like my body? A MM. B uh, normal. GOOD. No complaints. R Have you noticed these latest changes in your behavior or your thoughts? B No, it's the same as ever. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B uh last night. I had time with my friends and I just, like a very good time, share stories and laugh and all that. A it's great. How would your best friend describe you? B uh, probably funny and easy to get along, but also attentive. To tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B I spend my ideal weekend not to really do much. Like, maybe just sitting or going to the movies, watching television. There is something you regret? B No, I don't think there is not. I don't think. I think regretting things is a waste of time.

What are the things you really like? B diversity. My girlfriend is Taiwan, therefore. Dealing with different cultures. What are the things you don't really like at it? B Traffic, crazy. It seems difficult to get something really accomplished. R I see what you mean. How easy did you have to get used to living in Los Angeles? B It took me about six months to understand the instructions. When did you move to the? B 28 years ago. A wow is long. B for a long time. How often do you go back to your hometown? B I haven't been there for about eight or ten years. One why? B Well, I don't like my brother, so I don't want to hang around around him. A good. Do you travel a lot? B I started. My girlfriend we did. I went back, came back from Orlando and she likes to travel, then. A beautiful. What do you like on travel? B Meet new people, see new places. I help me get out of Los Angeles and get a different perspective. To I would love to hear about one of your trips. B I just made the Avatar seminar, which is like, lift your conscience and clean the shit in your head. Are you happy that you did that? Yeah, I feel better. I have a lot of psychic attacks, and I am psychic, so it's very difficult to deal with it. Tell me more on that. B well, there is more in life than you see. So many things are in other dimensions in other places. So you have to face emotions not only, but also to direct yourself energy. How difficult? B well, to make a lot of compensation and earthing and to remain faithful to yourself. A good. Do you consider yourself introverted? B I'm both. Well, I am introverted because I like to spend time by myself, and I am extroverted because I like to meet new people. I was totally an introvert. Watch movies, watch television, read, make crosswords. I am a singer. Sing, write music. Write a novel. It's a bit like the matrix. A great. How difficult is it? B well, I wrote the first 20 pages fairly quickly, so now I widen it. Decided to do it. B I get inspiration. It was actually a dream, then I wrote the dream, and now it becomes. I could probably make it a film. Yeah, well, people don't respect me. This is number one. Do you often feel this way? B No, I'm just. May my brothers, they do not respect me. They don't really do it, you know, I want to love my family, but I don't want to drag my brother. It is therefore a conflict. Exactly. How are you going to control your temperament? B pretty well. I only get angry once a year. My girlfriend, about two or three months ago, she wanted me to do something and I said no, and I don't know. Yeah. A good. How do you know them? B She is my girlfriend. I have known her for about a year now. How much do you have? B fairly close. A good, what is one of your most memorable experiences? B Once, I sang, and I sang with an audience, and it was great. A good, what are you doing now? B well, I am looking for ways to expand my conscience so that I can have more money and more abundance in my life so that I can have my own house and live in my own creative space. What is your dream work? B song. I am a singer, so I sing, as, unforgettable, that's what I like to do. A it's great. Have you ever served in the army? B no. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. How easy is it for you to have a good night's sleep? B well, this is the difficult part. I don't know. One why? B I don't know. It may be because when I was a child, my brothers beat me and I don't feel completely rested in me or my life. SO. So I feel like I don't feel completely safe. Yeah, a little irritable, but I sleep better since I met my girlfriend, so it's not completely bad. Have you noticed changes in your behavior? B No way. Have you noticed changes in your behavior? Permanently. B behavior what? I don't know. Well, I feel more positive. I did the seminar and it allowed me to get rid of shit in my brain and be more positive about life. Well, I did a lot of exercises to reduce my stress and a large part of my stress comes from myself and from others. R do you think you may be a little hard with yourself? B Yeah, you could say that. Well, I don't know. It's hard. Difficult to manage sometimes. Sometimes a lot. Far too critical for my good. How do you face them? B Well, watching television and all that. But lately, I have felt like I needed to have less judgment and more fun. A it's good. What decided you to do then? B I made this seminar. A good. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? B about a week ago, I think. Well, I went to this seminar, I arrived and I was able to remove the work, to be in a different environment because my work is stressful and what? My life is stressful. So I was able to take a break, which is great. Released, fun, intelligent. But I'm at the. The people of Los Angeles, they don't want. Most of them don't want to spend time with you. I do not know if it is because of me or the. Who makes sense. Is there anything you regret? B that I spend a lot of time worrying and criticizing myself instead of going ahead. Avoid it. Yeah. I watch television or I will see movies or try not to think about it, but that does not solve the problem. Well, a little. I haven't paid my bills much. I always owe money, so it's a kind of self-affected prophecy. What advice would you be aware for 20 years? B Stop criticizing and starting to create your future now instead of waiting for this to happen. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B My girlfriend was really useful. By telling me more about it. B well, she is funny and she loves me and cares about me and. Yeah. Do you know that you are some of your best qualities? B Singer and I am intelligent and creative and multidimensional and I am a good listener. What are you most proud of in your life? B I wrote on four or five pounds. My voice, I think, would be the number one because when I started, I didn't have much singing voice, but now I do it. A it's good. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing. B ok. Bye. Bye. Doorbell. Yeah. All right. Can I remove it?

"A All right, so now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit, and then when she's done, she'll let you know and I'll give you the doorbell to let me know. Okay. Here's the doorbell. B Okay. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yeah. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing okay. How are you doing? A That's good. I'm great, thanks. Where are you from originally? B I'm originally from, like, a suburb of la, from the San Gabriel Valley. A Really? What are some things you really like about la? B I like the diversity. I like the vibe of the city. I've lived other places and just not as happy here. I feel like I can really thrive here. So I just like la, like all the things that are so close together and there's a lot of interesting things. They're totally different parts of the city, just miles away from each other. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B I don't like the traffic, don't like all the cars. But I can live with it. I mean, there's not that much I don't like. A Okay. What did you study at school? B I studied music, Vocal performance. I studied music, technology, things like that. A Awesome. Are you still working in that? B Yes. A What do you do now? B Right now I sing in an opera company, but I do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the LA Opera. So I do have a day job. I work at a call center that caters mostly to performers and actors and things like that. And it's really good because if I get a call, I can call in and change my shift very easily. So it's actually a pretty good gig. And I do some technology gigs sometimes. You know, do some recording, some live sound stuff, but I kind of want to get away from that. Do some video work sometimes. But again, I want to get away from that. I want to go back to the. Because I find that performing more is more interesting. I like being talent more than I like being crew. So I kind of want to get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what I want to do with my life. A Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? B Sometimes. I mean, for my personal life, yeah. So I do have a shell that I put out there to deal with people, but if I'm at home, you know, I'd kind of rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever, Talk to family. Don't really have too many close friends, but, yeah, you know, I'd rather keep to myself. A How close are you to your family? B Moderately close to the family that I have left. I've actually lost a lot of family in the last 10 years or so. But, like. Thank you. But like, my close to my husband and, you know, I've got a couple of cousins I talk to and my aunt that I have an aunt that I talk to a bit. But it's not like we're interacting every day close together, but it's somewhat close. A Okay. What do you do to relax? B Mostly I sing or I read or I write or just hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts. Sometimes it doesn't work, but I try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in. And sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. But mostly creating things, contacting my family. So, you know, through Facebook or whatever works. But mostly in my free time, I create things. A Okay. Do you travel a lot? B I'd like to travel more. I like to travel by car a lot. My idea of, like, having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip, and I like to travel more. I would love to travel for work things or whatever, but I don't get as much of an opportunity as I would like to to travel. A What do you enjoy about traveling. B Particularly traveling by car? Seeing, like, the landscape change, seeing people change, seeing, you know, feeling the vibrations of the area change. I like just seeing what's out there. And I know that there's a bigger world outside of where I am and where I live and my world. I like to see that, but I like to leave that too, and go back to my own world. A trip that I like to take is to make the drive from here to Nevada. Whether I go all the way to Vegas or just go to. To State line, My cousin and I would take what we call Exit 1 trips. Because once you get to the first exit of a highway, you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway. So we take those. We're just sort of impromptu with a day or two notice, just move things around, just take off. So those Are actually trips that I like making because I take off and then just come back. Sometimes the same day, sometimes overnight. Just small short trips that aren't very involved, but you just get to go and you see things and see how the desert landscape looks in different seasons, how people react in different times of the year in different areas. So close to home, but not close to home. Close to home, but still a world away because I don't really have time to take a two week vacation or whatever. But it's just little things that kind of put things back in perspective and clear my head and things like that. Because there's sort of a sense of meditation and Zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway. So I like doing that. A When was the last time that happened? B The last time that happened was May of last year. So last time I was able to do that, we actually. My aunt came over with my cousin who is 10 years younger than I am, and we kind of grew up like sisters. And I was about to move away from the Inland Empire, which is where they live, so they kind of took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to Vegas and looked around and came back because I actually lived in Vegas for a while, but I didn't like it. So they kind of. I showed them some of the local sites around there and we came back and was, you know, an overnight trip, but we were driving the entire time. That's kind of interesting. Things that are just inherently unfair. When people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals or people who can't fight back, they're mean to them just because they can't fight back. And I actually like to see people who are as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate or what have you. So I think that's one thing that makes you really mad. Just being cruel or mean for no reason. You know, not for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it. That kind of really just makes me mad. A Okay, what do you do when you're annoyed? B When I'm annoyed, I'll try to just walk away from the situation. And if the situation is just on following me, then I'll wind up lashing out somehow either, you know, verbally just cutting them with a quip or, you know, I mean, rarely just, I rarely will yell at somebody, but I'll try to, you know, if I'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work, then I'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me. That usually works. Not in like legal trouble or anything because usually I'll find a way to get them to leave me alone. There's not really like big trouble, but I think because it is off putting and it's not the expected reaction and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction because I know that will work and get people away from me. So it's not really in trouble. And if it is trouble, it's usually trouble that it's from the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because due to a situation I can get out of. So as long as they leave me alone, I'll walk away from it. A Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone? B The last time I argued with somebody like, like a per. Like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my. The last thing I could think of was I argued with my husband about the care of my mother in law because she's got dementia. And so we. One of the reasons we came out here from the Inland Empire was to take care of her because she won't go anywhere but la. I mean she's like hardcore Angeleno. We know we are that in our nature, but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere. So we came out here to take care of her and he wants her to be able to stay in her apartment and I want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us. But she wants to stay where she is because she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process. But he wants her to stay where she. He wants her to be able to have what she wants. Because he's a mama's boy like I am. I'm a mama's girl. Even though I have lost my mom like four years ago, I'm still a mama's girl and I'll still. And I still, you know, I know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much. That's what they want. So you want to get it for them. And because that happened when you were growing up, when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it and you want to do that for them now, like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about, somebody you feel deserves it. But it's kind of dangerous for her and I don't want something to happen to her yet. I want her to remain who she is for as long as she can. Because I know a disease that she has is going to erase who she is eventually. And eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her 24 hour medically trained care. But until then, we can handle it amongst ourselves. It's not that bad, but it's getting where she really has no business living by herself anymore. So the solution right now is he stays there most of the time with her and I go back to our house and it gets stressful and it gets annoying because I do, I handle the outside things, I run the errands, I take her to the store, things like that. He does the day to day things, make sure she eats, make sure she, you know, has clean clothes, things like that. So I mean it's a partnership, it's a, it's a dual effort. It's very much a dual effort. But I would like her to move in with us. So that was, that's like source of. It's not really like yelling, screaming argument, but lively discussion, you know, and debate. It's not insurmountable. I mean, life's not going to be easy ever. You know, if it is, that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you. So as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life, it's not going to be easy. But you deal with it and you move on. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B The most positive influence I think have been probably my mother and my grandmother because my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually gave me a lot of confidence but were realistic about it. So I mean, I think I have sort of a realistic, sort of a downer temperament to myself. But they help me see that it's just in me and it's not something I can't get over and that, you know, life's going to go on. You know, my mom would say to me, when you're 40, you're 40, whether you're working at McDonald's or doing what you want with your life. I think that was a big influence on how, how I've lived my life since she's passed. A That's great. Is there anything you regret? B I regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because I think it may have clouded some of my decisions. Now, I do have underlying conditions, and everybody in my family is diabetic. And I didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life because I was too busy wanting to get her home. My focus was to get her home. So I didn't eat right, I didn't take my insulin right. I wound up making myself insulin resistant that. That year just because my blood sugar was so high for like a year, eating just horrible foods when I did eat. So it really took a toll. And I really actually made myself very sick. And I'm wondering, well, if I didn't, if I would have taken care of myself and I had my head on completely straight, my vision and my thoughts weren't clouded, would I have made some better decisions on her behalf, especially when she needed them and when she needed me to step in and make the decisions for. Because she wound up having a health catastrophe because she had kidney. She had kidney damage. It wound up being kidney failure, and her health insurance provider missed that. So she wound up having sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down. She wound up having a stroke at like 51. She had a small stroke, and it just kind of went down from there. So I'm thinking, well, if I didn't, If I had taken better care of myself, would I have been able to take better care of her? And I know there wasn't anything I would have been able to do to prevent her death, but would I have been able to make it easier on her if I would have taken care of myself? That's, like, one huge regret that I have. A Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? B Oh, I know I am. But it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that I care about. Taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine. And I know other people, I can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings and they can't, you know, be what I want them to be. And I know they're not going to be, but I still have, you know, my ideals and I want the way I want everything to go, and I want everybody that I care about to be happy and to be able to fit into my life in a way, in the best way possible. But I know because they're other beings and I'm not going to be able to do that for them, then I can be able to do that for me. But it's still by ideals. So I have to sometimes have to look at it and go, well, is this what I want? Because I want it. Or what is what they want? And is it their decision or mine? And she's. It's theirs. I know it's theirs. So if you really care about somebody, you're just gonna support them and go with them. But it's still kind of hard for me, and I know I gotta get over it. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B 10 or 20 years ago, probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because I wound up taking care of my mother. I mean, she got sick literally the weekend I graduated from college, and I had a job lined up, and I had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her. I think I would have been more aggressive about starting my own life, getting a job outside the house in addition to caring for her, getting my own job history, my own credit history. Things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about 10 years. So I think I probably would have done that, but I told myself, just do that and keep who you are and learn to separate who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family. To keep a sense of yourself. That's probably what I would have. And do things for yourself, to keep that sense of yourself. That's probably the advice what I would give myself 10 years ago. A Okay. Have you ever served in the military? B No. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No, but probably because I haven't gone to a doctor about it, because I don't want to know. I mean, it's not. I know there have been times in my life where I've been severely depressed, and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it, but I'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment. Can you see an example of that? After my mother had died, I mean, it had been this long battle for a year that we lost, and I didn't know if I was to blame for that. It's like, logically I knew I wasn't, but how could I convince myself of that? Two weeks after she died, I wound up with pulmonary embolisms, one in each lung, because I didn't take care of myself for a year. I figured, well, I'm 30 years old, if, you know, whatever I do to myself, I can get over no turns out, no. But I wound up having to Take more medication because of that. It's been a fight to get my own health back, to get to be able to get out of that depression because so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter. All of a sudden I didn't. It's like the rug was pulled out. My, like, bottom fell out of my world after that. So that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression. I almost got divorced because of it, because I just didn't want anything anymore. So. And I was being really distant from my husband by then at that time. We were married for about two years at that point, and I started getting very distant from him. Just pushing everything away, just, you know, figuring out what am I going to do with the rest of my life now. And it's been a fight. There are times when, no, I couldn't get up, just stay in bed and sleep all day. But then realizing that when my mother died, I had four casts to look after. Two were mine, two were hers. So I wound up adopting the two that were hers. Well, they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own supplies. I took that responsibility of doing it for them. So that was one motivating factor, was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not I was going to get up and provide for them. I mean, I could go without eating. I could go without taking care of myself, but they couldn't. They didn't, you know, so they actually got me up and made me go out and face things, even though I didn't want to just kind of want to curl up and die. But that would have been my choice, not theirs. And they. I mean, what would happen to them if I wasn't there to take care of them? They would have been, you know, sent to a shelter or whatever, probably. And maybe they would have not been read home and adopted by somebody else. Maybe they would have been killed for. For me. I mean, for me making selfish decisions. So it's like I need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed. And that's actually been a motivating factor is to take. I figured out that if it was just me, I'd be able to live without a lot of stuff. I mean, I would be able to live in my car if I wanted. It wouldn't be a big deal. I wouldn't care as long as I was doing what I wanted with my life. But I have a family to look after now, so I have to go out and do things, you know, I have to go out and look for legitimate work, you know, day job. I have to, you know. But I'm trying to strike a balance between the two because there's what I want to do with my life, but yet I have to take care of my family. So I'm working on a balance of the two. A How hard is that? B Very. But it's worth it. I mean, it would be very. I'd have a lot less things to worry about if I just lived in my car and said, forget it. But keeping a residence down, paying bills, things like that, it's difficult, but you have to do it. If you ever want anything in your life, you have to go through that. And I know that. But it gets hard. Sometimes you do want to give up. But then it's like, well, what's the alternative? I mean, I don't think I could live a comfortable life because if I did, I wouldn't do anything. I have to be slightly uncomfortable or I'm not going to do anything with myself. I'm just going to be content, Just hang out all day, stay in bed, hang out with my cats or whatever, and I wouldn't get anything done. A I see. How have you been feeling lately? B Very anxious and nervous and I mean, what if I don't find enough, you know, enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever? What if, you know, what if I can't keep a semblance of stability in my life? And it's actually hard work to be stable and I know it's hard work to be stable, but what, you know, it's just a lot of what ifs and it's things that haven't happened. And it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened. And I know that, but it still have. It still creeps in. So that's actually a source of anxiety when they try to let the anxiety go by getting things done, figuring things out, making a solid plan and going for it. But I know it's a cycle and I'll go from being really anxious and, oh my God, what am I going to do? What am I going to do to saying, okay, what is the fundamental thing I need to take care of here? I mean, what is just extraneous and what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue? So figure things out that way. And then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit. But then something will pop up and the what ifs will come up again. I'll have to figure it out again. But I know it's a cycle. I know. And what seems huge on the surface, when you start chipping away at it, you get over it pretty quickly. You get through it. A Yes. When was the last time you felt really happy? B The last time I felt really happy. I don't know. Like, huh. It's a good question that actually surprisingly stumped me because I do feel happy sometimes. Sometimes not so much. Sometimes just kind of in the middle. Really, like over joyously happy. I don't know. I can't think of when that happened. A Okay. How would your best friend describe you? B I don't know. You don't know? Perceptions of other people. I mean, probably as somebody who, oddly enough, somebody who is laid back and, you know, handles things as they come, but I don't see myself as that at all. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Probably that I can think on my feet and I'm not afraid to hustle my butt off and do whatever I have to survive and get things done. And I can do it creatively. And I try to strive for balance. Probably the best things about me. A That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? B That I'm doing basically what I want with my life, which is even though it's not all easy, it's not. I'm not financially well off or anything, it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives. Because I have an aunt that I really don't talk to. And the reason why I don't talk to her is because she's always miserable. I mean, she's got a career that she. It's more of a job that she fell into because my older aunt loves animals but didn't want to be a veterinarian. So she became a dog groomer. And she was actually really good at it. She had a stable business for a long time, but her, you know, she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had. Actually, my cousin's father went and kind of stole all the money from her business. So she lost her business and she kind of. She retired early because between that and the arthritis, she wound up retiring early. She employed my younger aunt, who is still a dog groomer, but she hates it. And it's like, change your life. If you hate your life so much, change it. And the thing I'm most proud of is, yeah, I'm not as financially well off as she is, but I'm doing what I want with my life. You know, I can be creative. I can have creative people around me, people who I actually like to talk to around me, people I actually like in my life and be happy with that. And I see a lot of people who aren't. And it gives me a sense of maybe a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say I'm not like that, that I'm actually doing what I want. Even though there are sacrifices, I'm still fundamentally doing what I want with my life now. A That's so good to hear. B Thank you. A I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Thank you.

"R but when you deal with humans, you have to face feelings and emotions. Not with that, however. B Very well, so she will come here, she is a volley, then shake it. And then I'm just going to adjust this a little so it's not so ridiculous. A whole? B ok. Now I'm going to start it. And she finished. She will say goodbye. A whole? Any all-terrain. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. A salvation, Ellie. B to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? Yes, I am. B ok. So how are you today? An exceptional. B Where do you originally come from? In Syracuse, New York. What are the things you really like about the Weather? What are some things you don't have. B really about it? Traffic and crime? B do you travel a lot? Why? A well, I made most of my trips to the army, so I have already been in the world twice, so I saw everything I need to see. B What is one of your most memorable experiences? An Hiroshima memorial in Hiroshima, Japan. Seeing people who survived the bomb attack that had disfigured parts on their body engraved in my brain forever. B What have you studied at school. A in the army? Aviation order. B What are you doing now? A I am a disabled veteran waiting for a pension and everything I can do to earn money legally. B What is your dream work? A shopping cart for tiger woods. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? An outgoing, but I'm shy in some regions. B tell me about your relationship with your family. An almost non -existing. But there is communication. B Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? A walk. I went down to the north of Broadway in East Los Angeles. B How are you going to control your temperament? A pretty good. I am known to fly from the handle, but the more I get older, the less I do. B when when you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? Perhaps about a week ago and it was on the use of the Internet. B tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. To everything that comes to mind. Jump into conclusions on certain things with my girlfriend. Sometimes I fight against mental health problems due to the army. And sometimes I say the bad thing or I make false accusations and I suppose things. But I never let him go too far. B What do you feel guilty? Many things I said that I didn't really want to say. Probably to be paranoid on things and. Yeah. B tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. A if I was going to live after being released from the military. B served in the army? A yes. B How old was you when you joined the army? At 18. B Why did you decided to enlist you in the army? A my brother was an active sergeant-major in the army and my parents were both died. And I had essentially nowhere where to get the graduate of secondary studies. Grew up quickly. B are you happy that you did that? A yes. I'm sad that I got out. I should have stayed in 20 years. I was in a fighting situation twice. I was in the bodies of the United States and I was activated to attack against Libya and it never passed. President Reagan canceled it. And I was also recalled that the Gulf War is working on 20 millimeter pistols. And I was on an LPH, a naval ship, quite close to the fighting in the Middle East and in the Persian Gulf. B Very good. How easy for you to go back to civilian life? A fairly easy. First of all. I was angry, guy, when I did the adjustment, but I had a big alcohol problem and it was. It was. It was one. It was an experience, traumatic to that. But, you know, I went. B I'm sorry to hear that. A step so bad. B What did you do after the army? R I worked for certain biomedical companies and software manufacturing companies as delivery and reception, stock analyst, material manager, things like that. I also worked part -time as a security guard and a lot of different things. Yeah. B ok. How did the army service change you? Gave me discipline, gave me good qualities such as punctuality and attention to details. And we do not fear that no one fears any man. B ok. How do you feel recently? A good lately. But I fight with mental health problems such as ADHD, depression, SSPT. B Have you noticed these changes in your behavior lately? R they were more positive. A little more positive. I am not. It's quite difficult. Quite hard. Amaids of Annex 2, amphetamines for ADHD is needed, so that does not help. And I am basically, I vanished more than I fell asleep. B How are you when you don't sleep? A well, I learned to cope with it. All right. I am not grumpy or irritable. I'm coming. If I don't have Everything that is nice to say, I say nothing at all. But there were times when I was a little angry. B Very good. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? One yes, once. B For how long have you been diagnosed? 10 years ago. May 15 maybe. B What were your symptoms? A strong dream activity, reviving experiences in the past. Not being able to fall asleep and rage. Unconscious rage crises and things like that. Are B triggered by something? A training in combat in the navy and real. Almost entering a situation like this is quite traumatic. Even if you do not enter the situation, the training to this point is safe. And all of a sudden, you need to use what you have been formed, a safe environment and taking it in a dangerous environment is quite traumatic. Fear of the unknown. It's not so much. Time heals everything. I am a fervent supporter of this. And I had a dream recently. On this subject. And this is the first I had in perhaps a year or two. It is slowly deflating. B What made you ask for help? To the go when I. When I went for the first time to get primary care and they watched my file and I thought I might be examined. B Very good. Are you still in therapy now? A no, I don't do it. Not for the SSPT, no. I was briefly going to some classes. B Why did you stop? R It was no longer really a problem with me. I take care of that. And it's like I said, time heals everything. I believe that. And that's. The nightmares are rare and far from here and I am comfortable without him. B I'm sorry. It was not your fault. B Do you think therapy is useful? A yes, if your heart is there. B Can you tell me? A well, if you have to do something, you are not really going to put your heart there. But if you really want to ask for help and you really want, really something, you try to get it from your heart. B What kind of changes have you noticed since you have been in therapy? A I am more. I eat better, I take care of my needs in physical and mental health. And I no longer avoid doctors or hospitals. I will get help. B when will you go back the last time you felt really happy? A today. B Can you tell me? A well, I have been in a relationship for about six months. I am 50 years old and she is 23 years old. And it makes me young, in a way. And I have a good woman by my side now. I was alone for many years, so it's a good feeling. B Who is someone who has had a positive influence in your life? Social work Kers and doctors at the VA who. It treats you with respect and really try to help you. B How would your best friend describe you? A person who never dropped him. B tell me about something you have done recently. Recently that you really enjoyed. A beautiful. B What are you the most proud in your life? A serving my country and obtaining honorable release. B ok. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. A good, my pleasure, Ellie. Bye.

"A good. And in fact, let me move this. B I'm going to move this behind your arm if you don't do it, just so it's. An out of your way completely. Very good, great. So now I will give you storage. When she has finished talking, she will let you know and you can press this button. B ok, cool. THANKS. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And please, don't hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B UM, pretty good. A it's good. Where do you come from? B with regard to my parents. Ethiopia. A really? B yes. What are the things you really like at? B beaches, hot weather, the diversified environment. What are the things you don't really like at it? B Traffic. Yeah, I see what you mean. What do you study at school? B well, I'm currently at school. I study African studies. A fee. How did you decided to do this? B I have always been interested in African studies. In fact, I always wanted to help people, and I told myself that I could help them trying to learn it and return to Africa and make an influence. A it's great. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B in a way between the two. I have my timid moments, but when I am with a group of people I love, I am quite outgoing. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B to relax? I write normally. Or I go to the beach and I sit there, I play my guitar. How are you going to control your temperament? B pretty well. I don't really get angry or something like that. I tend to keep it or try to publish it by writing. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B I don't remember the last time I argued with someone. A good. What do you feel guilty? MMM. B everyone I have injured in the past. Can you tell me? B Well, I, as, deceived people, injured their feelings, intentionally. Do things that I shouldn't have done that I regret. R Now, tell me about a situation you want you to manage differently. Hobo. Well, with my ex, I could have ended it so that we can be in better term now. I probably shouldn't have argued as much or try to provoke so many things. I should probably have let go with the flow and see how it turned out. To Tell Me on the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. B UM, the most difficult decision I ever had to take was. Dude, I really don't know, actually. A good, tell me about an event or something you want to be able to erase from your memory. B UM, having to see my father undergo surgery and see him suffer. To tell me about it. Well, he had a tumor that he had to be removed, so it was just difficult to see him having to be in bed and being just in the hospital when he really didn't want to be there because he is a really alive and he preferred to run and stuff like that. But seeing him just stuck in his bed was simply terrible. Real, it sounds really difficult. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B me and my family are not very close. We don't do it. I mean, they have always been there for me, and I appreciate it, but we have never had this close connection, especially because they are foreign. So they don't really understand where I try to come, having grown up in America. It is therefore quite different when it comes to racial. I mean, the cultural borders on which we each pass on our feet from each other. But other than that, we have a decent relationship. When we talk, it becomes a little embarrassing, but it's okay. What do you think of today's children? B I think they are out of control. I think they learn things that they should not know at this age. I think they do things they shouldn't do. And I don't feel like enough people tell them that they shouldn't do it. I feel like I was applauded by the media. They are applauded by celebrities they follow, and there are not enough things about it, and they get lost. One yeah. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B depends on the night. Some nights are quite difficult. Some nights I fall asleep like a baby. How are you when you don't sleep? GOOD. B generally creative. In fact, when I can't sleep, I'm going to stand up and I will write something or I will read a book and the ideas will appear. Tips like it is usually a good thing. When I can't sleep, it's nothing wrong because I have bad thoughts or something like that. A good. How do you feel recently? B lately? Between a mixture of good and bad, I have my happy moments I am energized and I am live. Then some days when I'm just, you know, just sitting there, just a soft thought, not like my living self. One why? B I don't know. It has always been like that. Always have these ups and downs, but they are somehow. A MM. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B UM, the last time I felt really happy was. Hmm. Today. By telling me more about it. B just from the moment I woke up, it was a beautiful sunny day. I went to see friends. We had a good time, went to school, had good grades on certain newspapers, wrote a good try, we felt quite accomplished. And I have the impression that my day is just a good day. A it's so good to hear. How would your best friend describe. B My best friend would describe me as strange. Most people would describe me as strange. One why? B I say a lot of strange things. I do strange things. I am interested in the things that most people are not. One like what? B just like old literature, revolutionary things. Tips on the change of the world, but by underground means. A fee. Is there anything you regret? Hobo. No, me. I do not live a life of regret. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B to never let fear prevent you from doing anything. At uh huh. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B um, reading. Just spend time with friends, driving, finding something to do. Go on an adventure. What are the things you want to change about you? B I don't want to be able to change anything about me. I would just like to be able to transform myself into the person I am really supposed to be. In Tell Me on a time when someone made you feel really bad. B This time, me and my best friend we are disputed and she underlined everything I did that I shouldn't have done everything at the same time. How I injured people, how I injured it. The ways I have made them. Which were brutal. And it made me feel bad once I thought about everything. One yeah. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B my parents. Can you tell me? B I mean, although we did not see the eyes, they always bring me to this awareness that I need at the end of the day. Although I never listen to them or I don't choose to listen to them. Once it happens, I shoot and I say to myself, oh, that's what my parents told me. So I learned to trust them more and I learned in und And that they are wiser than me and that they know more than me. R I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B not so much. I travel around Los Angeles, try to find new sites to see. But as far as I do not travel outside. What do you like in travel? B Discover new things. Discovering things you never knew was where the unlimited possibilities? I like to discover new people, new cultures, new things that go against what is normal for us and for me. R when is the last time that happened? B a few days ago. I just went in the middle of the desert and I sat there and I just enjoyed everything the desert had to offer. And it was simply pleasant. A beautiful. How did you feel at that time? B I felt free, far from all these cities and these buildings, and it was good to go out in the middle of nowhere at a completely random moment. I felt good. What are you most proud of in your life? B I'm very proud to have always been different. This despite how many people told me that I am really weird or that I am strange or I think that bizarre things, I have always maintained my original mentality. A good. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye.

"To so I just answer the questions. All right. She will chat with you a little, and then when she is finished, she will. B let you know and I will give you the doorbell so that you can do it to me. Knowledge when you are well. Thank. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? A yes. B ok. So how are you? A I am fine. I come from Los Angeles, California. B really? What are the things you really like? A wow. Wonderful time. Outdoor activities all the time, too crowded. Pollution, standard. I study children's communications. Recently, I'm just. I would say, yes. Preschool teacher? Well, I have always worked with children since the age of 18. So I thought of doing something, helping someone, it doesn't pay well, but you are investing in the future. Wow. A job that I could be paid to be outside all day. Be well paid to be outside all day. B you consider yourself an introvert? A yes. I'm a bit calm, but I like it too. I would probably say Borderline. I like outdoor activities, but I mainly do activities probably by myself. So, yes, I would say that I am a little introverted. B What are the things that are really going crazy? A wow. Just maybe a racist or disrespectful person. B What are you doing when you are annoyed? R I put in a way and re -evaluated how I am as a person, how I come back to other people. I cannot change someone else's personality, but I can work alone. B How are you in control of your temperament? A I am pretty good. B is good. When will you go back the last time you argued with someone? What was it? R I generally do not discuss with people. I usually go away. I mean, an argument is not satisfied with anything. Wow is a lot of things I regret, but that's not something I can control. The biggest regret was probably to lose my mother. THANKS. B How far are you close? R I was extremely close to my mother. Who I am as a person, who made me as a person. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A wow, 20 years ago, I told myself not to be so angry, so upset all the time of things that I cannot control. I told myself to relax and not be so hard with myself. B ok. What do you think of Cindy's children? A I think t The hat is pretty cool. I think you should have different ways to deal with different people. B ok. Have you ever served? R No, I don't have it. No, I don't have it. Yes. Less than a month. I realize that I must evaluate myself as a person, so I can really turn to no one else to help me unless I start with myself. No, I don't do it. B Why did you stop? R I feel like a person, as an individual, I have the impression that I should be able to control things myself. I feel like I am looking for help is good for someone else. It's probably very good for others. I have already worked with this population of SSPT veterans, so I know that it helps a lot of people, but I don't have the impression that it is for me. B How difficult is it? R it is not at all difficult. I have always been like a loner, someone who tries to manage my own problems and situations. A little depressed, but I think everyone has a little sadness at some point. Day after day, day after day. I just started an exercise program, so I try to look at myself for the solution. I always knew since I was a child, things move to other children differently. So I felt like I was always different. I felt like if I was going to understand myself as a person, then I should work on myself. SO. Yes. B ok. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? A today. I could see my best friend after a long time. So, I mean, happiness goes and goes, but I felt happy today. B it's great. How would your best friend describe you? A wow. He would say, really silly. But when I'm around him, I try to be happy. I try to present a situation where we will both be happy. No one wants to be with a depressed person. B would you say that some of your best qualities are? A wow. I mean, on some days, everything could be my best quality, but I would say that I am faithful, I am reliable. I would just say that I try to be there in the moment. I am not a person who is really flashy or in materialist things, so I have the impression of being very anchored. Oh, my mother, by far, my sister. My mother was a teacher, which made me want to become a teacher. And that's essentially what I do. My sister has been at work for 40 years, so I have always had a stable influence in my life. B It's so good to hear. What is one of your most memorable experiences. A wow. I would just say sitting on a beautiful sunny day talking to my mother, I would say that it would smile immediately. Wonderful, wonderful. B What are some things you love E do for fun? R I like to go out and play sports. I play four or five different sports. And I like to take a walk. I like to cycle. I like to go out and be active. Having such a wonderful mother, I mean, I must continue to come back on this subject because we were introduced into this life and it is our first teacher. It is our first teacher and will be our teacher for a very long time. And I'm just very grateful. I am very proud to have had a woman as wonderful as my mother. B tell me about something that you recently did that you really enjoyed. To cycle. Simple things. Go for a walk with my sister, exercise. B when will it go back the last time it happened? Last Sunday. B is good. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. A well, thank you. Little.

A Okay. All righty. B Allie, thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Yes, I am. B Okay. So how are you doing today? A I'm feeling fine, thanks for asking. B Awesome. Where are you from originally? A I'm originally from California, born and raised. And I live in Carson at the moment. B Nice. What are some things you really like about la? A I love the beaches, the sun and the amusement parks. B What are some things you don't really like about la? A The traffic. Louisiana Traffic is hectic. B I see what you mean. Do you consider yourself an introvert? A Nah, not really. B Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? A I read and I listen to soft music, like jazz or something. B What are some things that make you really mad? A I don't like people to walk in front of me, don't say, excuse me, cut me off in traffic when I'm driving. I don't like a tailgater. Little small comments, like small remarks that people may make that may upset me. I just don't like to be. I'm easily aggravated, so I don't like to be aggravated. B What do you do when you're annoying? How are you? A I'm pretty good at controlling it sometimes, but at times I can get very irate. So I'm working on that right now. B That's good. When was the last time you argued with somebody and what was it about? A Oh, I haven't argued in almost a year. But when I did, it was over a girl. It was my ex boyfriend, it was over a female. But it's over now, so I haven't had any real arguments since almost a year. I studied in college. I did child development and I also studied computer science. B What do you do now? A Right now I'm a homemaker. I don't work at all. I haven't been working in about three months now. Was laid off, but I was doing receptionist work. So I'm currently looking for employment at this moment. B That's great. What's your dream job? A My dream job is to own my own design graphics computer shop. Which means when you do your. You graphic your designs online and you send them to different distributors and what they do is they approve or they approve or disapprove what they like or dislike about my designs, if they want to go ahead with it, they'll buy them from me and then they'll go from there. B Really. Do you travel a lot? A No, I used to in the past, but not at the moment. B What's one of your most memorable experiences? A When I went to Hawaii with my daughter and my mom, it was very delightful. We stayed for almost two weeks, and it was not even two years ago. It was very, very nice. And I wish I could go back. The beaches were beautiful, the food is great. The luaus were great at night. It was really, really nice. A great experience. B That's great. How close are you to your family? A Very close. My mother and my daughter, we're all three. We're like sisters. We couldn't be any closer. My parents, my grandparents who have now gone, their past, but they were a very positive influence in my life. My guy friend that I'm dating now, he's very positive in my life, so I have a lot of backbone, support. You can say I don't right now because I'm living with my mother and stepdad. I'm trying to move someplace on my own now, but it's kind of hard, not working at all. So I just have to wing it out until I can do better. B Do you have roommates? A No, it's just myself, my daughter, my mom, and my stepdad at the moment. B Okay. Have you ever served in the military? A No, I haven't. B Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? A Yes, I have. B How long ago were you diagnosed? A Almost two years now. No, I had no idea. Just always feeling down and out, clinging myself in, not wanting to be bothered with other the outside world. Just little mood swings and just can't sleep at night. All kind of little stuff that kind of got me feeling like something wasn't right about me. Yes, I do. B Okay. A Yes, I do. It's very useful. B Okay. Is going to a therapist helping you? A It is, very much so. The reason why I feel like it's helping me is because the lady who I see there at the therapy place, she's very nice. She. She's willing to help out in any way she can. She's almost to me like a psychiatrist. She's very good. I mean, she talks to me about things, encourages me to what not to do, what to do to help calm down, to feel better. And she's just very nice. All in all, I always leave there confident all the time. Number one, my mood swings. I've noticed a big change in that and my attitude. B Okay, how has seeing therapist affected you? A It affected me in a great way. I would never say negative because like I said, it goes back to the helpfulness I've received from the lady and from the therapist and the different ways I was coached on how to improve my lifestyle to avoid the problem that I do have right now I suffer with. So that's how it affected me that way. The attitudes, the mood swings. Couldn't sleep at night, depressed all the time, no outside company at all. Didn't want to be bothered with anybody, friends or family. Locked up in my room all the time, halfway not wanting to eat or overeating. It was just a lot. Maybe like any little thing would trigger me off. Like somebody could say something wrong to me that I would think was wrong. It would just trigger. I would just get triggered and just snap for no reason. It's just. I don't know what caused it besides that. B That's great. How do you cope with that? A Well, now I'm doing. I'm coping with it by not snapping as much and just trying to stay calm. And I just need a lot of positive environment around me, not negativity. That helps too. So with that being said, I just kind of maintain and keep my high self esteem up as much as I can. B Nice. How have you been feeling lately? A A lot better than before. B That's good. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts? A Yes, I have very positive thoughts. Very positive behavior. Much better than what it was. A very big improvement from before. B Do you feel that way often? A Yes, I have been for the past few months. I've been feeling a little better. I have at times, but today, no, I'm feeling pretty upbeat. It's not very easy, but I try. But for the past few nights, I have been sleeping the full night. So that's a positive for me. Very cranky, very groggy, moody. Actually, yesterday I received some good news over the phone and I was happy the whole day. I'm still kind of happy about it today too. So that was very good for me.

I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Oh, overwhelmed. A Why? B I have a funeral to attend tomorrow. I found out from my doctor I got some. Some health issues. A I'm sorry to hear that. That sounds really hard. B It is hard. A How do you cope with something? B Honey, I am just putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to get it done. A How hard is that? B Like I said, I'm overwhelmed, but I can't stop doing what I need to do. I am from the United States of America. I was born here in Los Angeles. A What are some things you really like about la? B Oh, I love the beach, honey. I like the weather. The beach and the weather. A Mm. What are some things you don't really like about Hillary? B Oh, the traffic and the people and this Hollywood type image. A I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B Not as much as I used to, but I've been to Europe. I went on a cruise. Several crews. Been to Jamaica, Canada, Mexico, Spain, Morocco, London. Portugal. Yeah. And I'm going to Hawaii in August. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Meeting new people and just seeing new things and just assimilating into other people's culture. Culture and customs and traditions. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B Oh, the best trip I ever took is when I was a student at Santa Monica College and took a. It was a Mediterranean cruise. Oh, my God. That was the best time of my life. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Oh, God. Being on that ship. A How did you feel in that moment? B I felt electrifying, fulfilled, satisfied. I felt like I can do it. And it just. I moved Past the fear and just said, I'm doing this. A That's great. What did you study at school? B I'm in law school. I'm going to be an attorney. A How did you decide to do that? B I've always wanted to be an attorney, and it's been a long time coming. A What's your dream job? B Oh, my dream job is to have my own law firm. My husband and I living in a beach community, and our friends, we know each other. The community, we know each other. It's a small town beach community. Having my own law firm, working with my husband and providing legal services to people who are indigent. A Do you consider yourself more shy or. B I'm in the middle. A Why? B It's one side of me that just like to withdraw and, you know, don't want to be out in the front. And it's another part of the personality is like, oh, no, we're being in the front. We're going to be seen. And we're constantly in conflict. A I turn on the fish tank screensaver. I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B Oh, I get on my bike and ride my bike. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Oh, it depends on what the situation is. I need to control that. A Has that gotten you in trouble? B Not trouble, but it has made people back up often me. A When was the last time you argued with someone? B Oh, God. When was the last time I really had an argument? I don't know. It's been a while argument. It's been a long time that I can't even remember. A Okay, tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Oh, God. Let's see. Oh, goodness. Oh. Just dealing with my siblings and my family and just trying to diffuse the situation and not get so heated and just remain cool and calm and collective. A Can you give me an example of that? B Oh, when my mother passed years ago, the conflict over her belongings and all that stuff and, you know, it's a stressful time, and everybody else. Everybody's emotion was kind of high and arguing back and forth, and I'm like, I'm not doing that. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B Distant. And I just. It's just amazing that these people. I shouldn't say these people that my. We grew up in the fam. We grew up in the same household. And then as we got older, you know, God takes us on different paths. It's just like, who are these people? Or did I grow up in a household? With them. Why are they. And they may say the same thing about me. I don't know. I just like to have peaceful living, honey. Pardon me. Oh, God. Positive influences. Oh. College professors, friends, church members, people like that. A Okay, tell me about. B Oh, God. Divorce. Should I continue with my education when my mother was sick, to be her primary caretaker, put all my dreams and aspirations on hold? Those have been some doozies. A Wow. What made you decide to do that? B Well, with my mom. You only have one mother. And when it was over, said and done, I just wanted to do what was right according to what God would want me to do. And I didn't want to have any curses over my life, but blessings. Because the Bible says, honor thy parents, my mother and father, in all thy days, so. So you can live longer. And I wanted blessings and not curses. A Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B My marriage. My marriage. Ah, God, that had such a negative influence on my life, such a negative impact. But in all that it taught me, it made me who I am today. And I have no animosity. A Is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Oh, lately it's been so difficult because school and finals and midterms and all that is coming up. Sometimes it's rather difficult. Irritable, annoyed, grouchy. Well, with all this stuff going on with the last week, it's been real, real, real, real, real crazy. God, I pray. I just. I pray, I pray, I pray, I pray, Lord, I pray. And the one thing that's keeping me kind of, like, grounded is going to choose. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No, never. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yeah, when I went through that divorce and my mother passed, I was really depressed, fatigue, tired. No matter what I did, I couldn't get any enjoyment. Just a feeling of emptiness and loneliness and isolation and shock, trauma. It was very, very, very, very difficult. Time, just time. It just took time just to process, to work its way through. A Do you still got a therapy now? B No, no, not at all. A Why did you stop? B Just got busy with life stuff. A Do you feel like therapy? B Yeah. I need somebody to talk to. Yes. A How is seeing a therapist affected you? B Oh, God, we. I love my therapist. We talk things out and she gives me a different perspective and she just listened to me. A That's good. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Oh, God. Was this guy at church, and I really like him and he likes me and he throws kisses at me. So I need to. Oh. Outgoing, determined. Yeah. Trustworthy, faithful and loyal. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Oh, God. To be more patient. To be more patient. A Okay, tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. B Oh, my ex husband, he did that on a daily, daily thing. And I'm just so glad to get rid of him. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Know your worth, your value, and have high self esteem. A Okay, tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B Well, now, with school in the library, with tutors, my outlet is riding my bike or either going swimming. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Oh, a friend of mine had a CD release party. Excuse me, excuse me. And me and another friend got together and we catered the party and it was so nice and they were so happy. They were so thankful and grateful. So thankful. And then he invited me on stage because he sings. And I felt so. When I got up on stage because I like to sing, but I'm so shy in front of people and they're judgmental and they might look at me. And I got up on that stage and I just. I like. Well, is this how this feels? This feels good. Oh, God. Oh, man. A Awesome. What are you most proud of in your life? B Oh, my accomplishments. Overcoming them one by one, setting a goal and reaching them. A That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. B Okay. A Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Thank you, hon. Bye.

Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing okay, just a little tired. A Where are you from originally? B I'm actually from Texas. That's where I went to all my school and I was a military brat. A What are some things you really like about la? B I really just like the size of the town. I mean literally. Seems like there's something to do. Just wish I had the energy to get out and do it. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B Traffic, the pollution. A Do you travel a lot? B Excuse me? A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Oh, let's see. Really, my memory is not really that great. Lately I've been thinking a lot about when I was in Japan as a child going up to Camp Mount Zuma. A What'd you study at school? B Studied X ray technology. I was an X ray technician for a couple years until I lost my license because of drug addiction. A What do you do now? B I'm now retired. I really don't do anything. I wouldn't mind working again, but I'd lose my benefits if I do. So with the economy being what it is, there's not a whole lot to do. A Uh huh. What's your dream job? B I'm sorry? A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I'm a pretty shy person. Find it difficult to make friends. A lot of trust issues, I guess. A Why? B I just don't really. No, I guess experiences of my past. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B Really? Our family was never very close. I mean we were a military family. Pretty much everybody did their own thing. I mean we did all get together for sit down to Avenue every night, but it was usually watching tv. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I like to watch a lot of movies. Just stretch out of my recliner. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Actually, I don't really have much of a temper. Kind of takes a lot to set me off. As far as getting angry, so I don't really have a problem with my temper at all. A That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Wow. Last argument with somebody was actually yesterday was just over something stupid about having individuals that aren't medically trained to putting your backpack in place, cracking your spine. A Mm. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Whatever comes to your mind. B Well, my life saw me when I was in the military. I was dating this really good woman. I wish I kind of had never broken off the relationship with her. I mean, I think my life would have went a whole different direction had I stayed with her. A What's something you feel guilty about? B I feel guilty about the way I broke it off with her over the. Let her come all the way out here from Virginia to Texas, where I was staying at the time, and then dropped the bomber that I don't think we have a future together. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B I don't know. A Okay. B I. I really can't think of any. Anything. I mean. A Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B I wish I could risk all that time that I was out there doing drugs and just screwing up my life, which I never even started. A Have you ever served in the military? B Yeah, I spent 11 years in the army. I got down after the. When they were doing the drawdown after the first Gulf War, Desert Storm. A How old were you when you joined the military? B I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand the question. I'm a little harder hearing. I'm sorry, I didn't catch. I was talking when you were getting ready to talk. A Are you happy you did that? B Am I happy with my thoughts? Not really. It seems like a lot of times it's just fill blank, like I'm not really thinking about anything. It's just kind. Kind of feel like I'm on autopilot. A Did you ever see combat? B No. I did. I never saw combat. I was supposed to deploy over there, but by the time my deployment rolled around, the war was already over. A Okay. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? B Actually, it was pretty easy. I mean, I was pretty hard charged and I already knew what I wanted to do. Go to X ray school, get my degree, start. Start being an X ray technician, which I did. So I kind of screwed that up by getting involved with drug. A Okay. What did you do after the military? B Well, I went back to school full Time. I mean, I got a severance pay when I got out, so I was able to go ahead and pay my rent up for the two years I was in school. Didn't have to work or worry about it. I just lived off my GI bill. Dressage was pretty easy. I mean, every now and then I'm. There were points in times that I missed. I missed the camaraderie. A I'm sorry. How did serving in the military change you? B Well, I mean, it gave me more focus. I was ready to go back to school, which is something I couldn't. I could have gone to college right when I was high school. I just was tired of school when the military kind of helped me calm down and get my thoughts organized and basically just got me focused to go back to school. A How have you been feeling lately? B How do I feel lately? A Tell me about that. B Lately I've just been a little tired, worn out. I don't know. I just don't feel like I have any energy to really do anything. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B Changes are. Like I said, it just seems like recently I just can't get started motivated to do anything. I'm not sure with people, but I just don't like being around a whole lot of people lately. And I'm trying to. Trying to break out of that, but it's not always easy. I get a little irritated. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Well, when I take my Seroquel, which is pretty much every night, I sleep pretty good. Only get up about once or twice a night to use the restroom. But I just. What do you like when you don't sleep? A Well. B I just drag. I don't want to do anything. I usually just. I don't sleep in a bed. I sleep in a recliner, and I just pretty much stay in my recliner all day and nod off when I watch tv. A All right. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Yes, I was recently diagnosed within the past year with ptsd. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yeah, I've been diagnosed with depression for several years now. Like I said, it's. I don't know what. Maybe I'm getting used to my medication or what's going on, but I've really, just really been feeling, I guess, down. How long ago were you diagnosed where the depression. It's been about three years, three and a half years when I was living in Riverside. A What were your symptoms? B Lack of energy, sleeplessness, constant worrying. A Are they triggered by something. B I'M sorry, I didn't understand the question. A Can you tell me about that? B Um, like I said, I just didn't. I'm a little hard of hearing and I really didn't catch the question. A How do you cope with them? B Um, how do I cope with my. Assuming you're answering how I cope with my feelings. Um. Like I said, I just. There's not a whole lot to do. I just deal with them. I don't know that I have any real coping skills that I use. I mean, I try not to focus on the negatives and stuff like that, but I don't really focus on positives either. A What got you to seek help? B What caused me to seek help? Actually I was due to my drug addiction. I was living on the streets and finally woke up one day was just tired of it. Ended up going to a shelter in Riverside where I found out that I'd VA benefits coming and that's when I started getting help. A Do you still go to therapy now? B I see my. I see a psychiatrist about every six to eight weeks. So yeah, I do actually. I'm very pleased with the doctor I've got here. The Long Beach VA actually takes time to listen. A Do you feel therapy is useful? B I feel therapy is useful actually. Actually sometimes I feel that it is useful. Just nice to sometimes get things off my chest. Not very good. Well, so I've been going to therapy. I noticed that I'm not. A You felt really happy? B I can't remember the last time I felt really happy. It's been. Been ages. A That's great. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Positive influence in my life is when I ended up@u svets here in Long Beach. I ran across a couple of guys that were in the same situation I'd been that were pretty straightforward guys and I mean people I really liked hanging out with. A How would your best friend describe you? B I don't really have any best friends, but most of them I think I'm pretty funny. I mean because I. I got a pretty crude sense of humor. I joke all the time. Which one thinks just a defense mechanism to avoid taking anything seriously. A That's. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B If I understood the question correctly. Something I really enjoyed. I used to be real. I used to really enjoy reading. I mean I go through a book every two or three days and just. I haven't been able to focus in over a year long enough to even sit down and read. That's what really gets me frustrated. I used to really be a real big reader. A Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? B I'm most proud of in my life. Well, going to the military, I was pretty proud of that. But the thing I guess I'm most proud of is my stop. And doing drugs. I mean, it was just waking up one morning deciding enough is enough. And I was able to stick to it and been clean over three years now. About three and a half. A That's good. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Thank you. A Goodbye. B Yeah, there's a couple questions I couldn't understand. I'm a little hard of hearing. Oh, okay. A I'm sorry about that.

"A good, now you will see our virtual human appearing for a second here, greeting hello, and then I will shrink it while I continue to install everything. B of course. Good morning. She seems kind. R So I'm going to let everything continue to launch here. B only five, ten. There we go. Okay, she therefore asks a few questions. B ok. When she says goodbye. Okay, great. A love to teach you about you. I will ask a few questions to get started. B ok. Please, don't hesitate to tell me anything. You are. Your answers are completely confidential. B ok. Yes I'm dong well. Unnauxed. A great. Where do you come from? B I grew up just outside Philadelphia and I moved to Los Angeles almost five years ago. A beautiful. What are the things you really like? B Time, that's for sure. In addition, I was a major film and a business minor at school, so I was released to be involved in entertainment. What are the things you don't really like at it? B Traffic, smog. Some people are a bit dizzy, but I generally like it. Do you consider yourself an introvert? B No, quite the opposite. I consider myself an extrovert. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I like to read, you know, glass of wine, maybe. Take an old film, try to get out of the apartment and maybe take a walk. Something like that. What are the things that make you really crazy? B cruelty. People do not use their people, being carefree or thoughtless, you know, do not really consider other people when they do things. What are you doing when you are annoyed? B generally vocalizes my discomfort, as, unless I think it would be really inappropriate in a moment. But I will usually inform someone as slowly as possible that I am a little bored by what is happening. How are you going to control your temperament? B usually quite well, but I also know, you know, there is a limit point where I pass and it is like, so I can no longer control it. So I have a long fuse, but sometimes a large amount of dynamite there. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone? What was it? B I had an argument with my girlfriend recently and it was, you know, we have very different communication styles, so I guess I did not feel heard and that she did not feel as if my answer was appropriate at the time. Maybe. A good. What do you study at school? B I was a movie and Medi A major in arts and a business minor and I have in fact obtained my master's degree in business administration at the moment, I am looking for work, preferably something related to entertainment, but I will take everything that will help pay the bills and allow me to continue living on the west side. What I really wanted to do was produce movies. It was therefore in a way my concentration in the major film. And I did some internships for production companies as the first cycle and in the program of my master's degree. And I like to work with creative people and develop stories and develop projects and be the person who can go from business and legal people to creative people and try to make everyone happy and make money. One really. Do you travel a lot? B I try. I mean, I'm a little low on the funds right now, but I really like to travel. I driven the cross-country when I moved from Philadelphia to Los Angeles. So I rolled on the east coast to Savannah, then everything across the south and southwest. I went to England four times. I went twice to continental Europe. Many islands, Montreal, is the only place where I went to Canada. But there are much more from the United States and Asia, Africa, Australia. These places to which I have not yet gone, but I would like to go there. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B I might say that the first time I left the country, the first time I went to Europe, we were able to take the train, the Express glacier, through the Alps in Switzerland. And it was incredible with snow and things like that. And I took a lot of photos and I don't know, it's one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen, so it really goes beyond me. A beautiful. How far are you from your family? B I am very close to my parents. I speak with my mother on the phone probably two or three times a week. I'm just talking to my father for fathers the other day. And, you know, he always. He sends me news, things he found interesting or stuff related to a film and things like that. I'm close. My sister, I have a niece and a nephew. I am very close to them. I speak to my sister a decent amount and I always see them when I am at home for the holidays. But they are all in the Philadelphia region, so I'm not physically around them. Perhaps once a year, twice at most, if there is a marriage or something like that. There was a lot, certainly my parents, some of my teachers in high school who encouraged me, like my social studies, like the cultures of the world Professor, one of my English teachers, my film program. I did a summer internship program twice, and they had done so. One of the teachers of my film 101 class was the moderator for this, so kept in contact with him too. How do you like your life situation? B I like it much better now. My last roommate was only. He was someone in the MBA program. It was also a year behind me, and he was just a terrible roommate. He has just moved. So I was replaced by someone else who is young and kind and he has the money to rent and he has a rabbit and he is like. He's a pretty cool guy. So I got a place of decent size. I have the biggest room of both and the rent is not too bad. And. And I can live, as, in the city of Culver, the side of Mar Vista of the city, which I really appreciate. So I like where I live and the rent is not bad for the neighborhood. No way. But I'm a little broken right now, so I have to come back again by working and calm the situation of money, but the life situation itself is fine. A good. Do you have roommates? B I have a roommate. Yes. Nice guy. A good. Have you ever served in the army? B No, I don't have it. A good. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Yes. Well, I mean, I suppose that in college, I have seen a cognitive therapist for some time, but I have never been under medication or something like that, and I have somehow distant it. But last summer, about a year ago, returned and I saw the individual advisor to school. I was doing group consulting sessions and they also had on Wellbutrin. So I suppose a year. Yes. What made you ask for help? B I had a dui, which, you know, all my consumption of alcohol, I think I really predicted more about depression and not to be able to manage this correctly. This was therefore part of it. And then just the stress of the school. You know, I had problems there, having problems in my relationship and, you know, was, like, a really low point and I felt terrible. So I decided that I should probably do everything I could do to improve myself. A good. Are you still in therapy now? B No, I took a school leave, so it's not really available to me. But I always go to a sobriety support group. And, you know, going back to school is a possibility, so I could start doing the advice sessions there. But my health insurance is exhausted, like two months, so I don't really have it. I will not really have a way to see someone unless I see someone, such as the Ministry of Health or some Something like that. So we will see. Do you have the impression that therapy is useful? B I do. I really think there are people who are probably under drugs that are not in therapy that should probably be. I prefer to make therapy without medication than drugs without therapy. That's sure. So I really think that it is positive to speak regularly with someone who is sort of withdrawn from your life and your goal and listen. This is really the most important part, it is having someone to listen to. A good. Is going to a therapist help you? B Yeah, I would certainly say that it was. Can you tell me? B Yeah, I mean, just having a dedicated time of about an hour, you know, 50 minutes, no matter where someone can listen to what is going on with you and offer possible advice in this direction, you know, in the direction you want to go. I think it's always positive, and that forces you to be, like, more aware of what really bothers you. When you have to vocalize it, when you have to look them in the eye and tell them what you feel and try to understand why and what you can do about it. I think it's always a good thing. What kind of changes have you noticed since you go to therapy? B My mood was much better. You know, it was a really lowered dark time, this last depressive period, so think of much more, like the future and what I do and the way I think about things and that as opposed, to stumble and to exist, I am, as, I try to think more about what I really want and what I think and things that are healthy and all the things that I should do. A good. How did the sight of a therapist affect you. B generally improves mood? What were your symptoms? B I didn't drink often, but when I was. I was drinking to get drunk. I was very. I was very depressed. There was a little weight. I slept a lot. You know, I just didn't like things I liked so much. You know, I'm worried about money. I was worried about the place. In what direction my life was directed, which I am still to a certain extent, but it is not like, making me fall so much now. You know, I was just caught in a period of decline, like a rut I couldn't go out. I think it was probably not successful in the things I wanted to do and that I have just been carried away on the day of the same thing, oh, well, I do not D to be at school because I don't have a job and I have no money. And I try to understand it and I will do this internship, and it will not really lead. And it was just a very, you know, I didn't move anywhere. I was stuck in one place and I didn't like it. Well, I don't drink. Not like that anyway. I'm just, you know, I try to be a little more aware of what I do and why I do it. You know, if I find it again at school, I will make advice again in group sessions. I don't know if I want to come back to medication. I felt like it was good for the time he was in, but I don't want to take something every day to feel good. I try to get back in shape now. I joined the local gymnasium and I think it will help me too. But the main thing will be what to do with my life because I am 30 years old now, so I have time to start the real career. A beautiful. How do you feel recently? B I'm fine. Really worried about the situation of money because I no longer have student loans to fall back and all that. So I'm quite broke. Therefore, do a virtual reality study. But when I am settled and I am again on a regular schedule and I do something where I am in financially security here, so I'm sure I will feel much better and I will be excited again. A beautiful. Have you noticed changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B probably more positive now. I would say that in general, I am always the situation of temperament. For example, I am always the same things that bored me in the past always bothers me, but they don't definitely do me. You know, there is just. I would be upset by something in the moment and I would need to express this, then find a solution or let it go rather than stay in this funk. So I feel more resilient, certainly. Do you often feel this way? B Yeah, most of the time. Well, as I said, I get angry for things. I am not someone who likes to keep things inside. But even getting them out in the past would not really make me cross them. It would be something that I should really go through and it would take me. It would certainly hold me. But now I feel a little more comfortable to feel what I feel and take it out and then try to solve it. Some days I do it, you know, but it's not every day and it's no longer like for no particular reason. I mean, I could b At the bottom because I am stressed, because I have a problem that, you know, I have to attack myself in life, as my lack of funds at the moment and, you know, trying to get in shape and, you know, try to understand what to do with my education that I have so far and find what I want to do. This is something that people should worry about. But I do not have the impression that it is an anxiety or something like that, you know, or sadness or fear dominate more. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B UM, it's usually going. I'm going to bed later and wake up later since I hadn't had a job. So that's something I have to be careful because I really have to start wake up earlier in order to ask for things and go, you know, meet people in person and try to understand something on the side of work. But I am. I sleep well. I'm not sleepy or something like that. There are certainly a few days when I want to stay in bed sometimes, but physically I feel good. It sucks. I mean, I am definitely. I almost feel like I have cold symptoms. If I have only four or five hours of sleep or something like that, I will, you know, I have a runny nose. I will feel a little feverish. I will be hungry at strange moments, like, I will just be very dilapidated, and I don't like this feeling at all. I try to sleep seven or eight hours every night. A good. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? B probably when I was at home during the holidays. Yeah, when I was at home during the holidays, I was able to spend a week and a half with my parents and my niece and nephew and my sister, and I could see some of my old friends. I could see a part of my extended family and, you know, just a generally good feeling. And it was also my mother's birthday on December 27, so it was also a funny opportunity. How would your best friend describe you? B I would say very intelligent, very funny, a little intense, a little crazy, but very faithful. Also generally a good person, a kind person. Is there something you regret? B I regret a lot of things in my life, I did things, like the dui. Really regret that. You know, I abandoned the first college where I went because things were really bad for me at that time. I mean, I somehow regret it. I think it may have been the right thing to do. But, you know, it was good to be able to finish school, you know, on time and start a career in this way. You kN Ow, I generally try to behave as I would feel comfortable sleeping at night after. But, you know, everyone fails something. So, every time I lied, whenever I left something, every time I know, you felt like you were wasted an opportunity, you know, I regret these things like most people. You are welcome. A bye. B bye.

C When I was 18 years old, my mother and my father decided that we wanted to move to California and so we dismissed Pasadena. In fact Monrovia first. And I've been here since. Yeah. B How often do you return to your hometown? C I did about two years ago. I went to work and I look around the region. B well. How easy did you have to get used to living in Los Angeles? C fairly easy, actually. I adapt. B is good. What are the things you really like? C hot weather, do not have rain nine months of the year. Mainly people. B What are the things you don't really like at it? C the region, what is the size, the traffic when I arrived here, the smog. It's better. NOW. B you consider yourself an introvert? C no. When I was younger, I was. But I got out of that with work. I did it, of course. When I became. When my mother died and I needed work, I went for a job called petition. And you have to go to stores and talk to people about signing petitions. And you do this after a while. You don't hesitate to talk to anyone. In addition, when I was in school, I spoke in public and I learned that I really liked it more than I thought. So I did the census work. In fact, I got up in front of groups of people and told them and Sh How to pass the test for them, and I appreciated it. Right now, I am working to get all my licenses to sell insurance and I will start working by trying to get people's money to help children in the world. B How did you decided to do this? C well, that. Helping Kids work was also paid work and I needed paid employment. The one for insurance was that I was getting older and I needed stable work. And this is something that I can do up to 85 or 90 years or other. B What is your dream work? C to be an artist. B really? Tell me more about it. Well, I have always been good with art. I like to draw, paint, etc. But I didn't know if I could never live in it. So I never really entered it. And every time I tried, it seemed that I never arrived anywhere. So maybe when I have 80 or 90, maybe I go in ceramics or something like that and do it as a profession. B do you travel a lot? C no, unfortunately I don't do it. It's good. B How far are you from your family? C I am not. My mother and father died. I have no brothers or sisters and the rest of my family has moved away or. Or I don't talk to them anymore or. Like that. B It sounds really difficult. C I have a kind of attitude that if I have me and my friends, I'm fine. B ok. What do you do to relax? C read, look at the sports when available. I used to play golf. I can do it again one day, but not for the moment because of the cost and time. B ok. What are the things that make you really crazy? C Impolite people. B What are you doing when you are annoyed? C I usually ignore it. This morning, in fact, I told a guy to stop what he was doing and we had a kind of argument on this subject. And then the argument was finished and it was done. B How are you going to control your temperament? It is very good, because I had a very bad character when I was a child and I told myself that I had to control it. B when will you go back the last time you argue with someone? What was it? C this morning? About the guy who makes a lot, a lot of express noise and in a place that was just not the place to do it. I mean, it was a public place, but. And that was everything. Just a small argument. And I'm finished with the argument. Once I say what I say yes. Not for the moment, I can think. B What things you like to do for fun. C as read. If I can travel, I travel. I do not travel over long distances, but even get out of the river is a kind of adventure for me. B What do you have to travel? C see things on the way and the back. Talking to people can be. B it's great. I would love to hear about one of your trips. Well, a number of years ago, I returned to the east to the Massachusetts to work there. On the way back, I took a Greyhound bus from Washington D.C. all the way to California in California first, then from there and I worked in Massachusetts for about six months to eight months. I really appreciated the region, but I didn't want to be there when the snow arrived and enjoyed returning to the bus. Had people next to me almost all along. Different people and had a lot of fun. Yeah, yeah. I was in the Air Force when I was 18 1965 during the Vietnam War. B Have you ever seen fights? C no, I was in Great Falls, Montana. B How did the army service change you? This is really not the case. Years later, I probably learned more from the fact that I went out early and maybe I should have stayed and stay with it. I tended to leave things when I was younger and therefore now with that and other things, I decide to never leave. B What did you do after the army? I came here, I played billiards for several years. Finally, a graduate of the school, which I abandoned when I moved. I went to the university, I obtained my baccalaureate and an AA diploma in Pasadena and Cal State La, and I started to occupy various jobs and that is almost everything. Taken care of my mother. Business was my major. I also studied things like anthropology, philosophy and history, etc. B awesome. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? C no. B Have you received a diagnosis of depression? C no, never do it. B How easy for you. C Get a good night's sleep lately? Not so good. Between the fact that I sleep in my car and it is very cold and that sometimes I receive. And with all the things that are happening in my life right now, I'm thinking of things and I get up at 4:30 p.m. It's good. I am tired and I become a little grumpy sometimes, but not very tired of everything I had to do and time and sleep. B Have you noticed these changes in your behavior or your thoughts lately? C no B How do you face it? C I continue. I tell myself to stop it mainly and continue to do things to improve myself. B How difficult is it? C do not. It took me years to study this, to do this. I do not know if you call it Zen or not, but a few months ago, when I passed all my tests and the advantage of Medicare passed each One of them for each company that sent me. B it's great. What would you say that some of your best qualities are? C I stick to everything I do now. I am persistent. I do not let things become uncontrollable before doing something. I was. What is the word? I pushed things back. I don't do that anymore. And I treat people well always until I don't give the reason not to do it. And I'm not talking about my bad things to anyone, generally. B How difficult is it? C not very, because the same thing I have trained over the years not to talk about me. I'm talking to other people. I talk about it. B Who is someone who has had a positive influence in your life? C see, my mother, Gandhi, Bertrand Russell. Let's see. I'm not sure who else I have had, but I don't remember their names where they were teachers, etc. Earlier in life, as I said, stopping everything, without finishing things that I regret a lot. B could you have done something to avoid it? Yeah, I could have done better. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? C probably the advice I gave myself to leave my buttocks and go to learn, get an education and continue my life and do something. B What are you the most proud in your life? C I survived. B ok. Can you tell me? Well, I am 65 years old. I have been sleeping in my car for several years. I went to sleep on the road where I had a car. While I did it, I improved my credit rating. I obtained a number of jobs of which I was very satisfied. I had a lot of friends, the two homeless and homeless people, and I am quite good health, while other people from my family are dead. So I guess that's almost everything. B Okay, what are the things that put you in a good mood? C good jokes, people who spend happy time, to go for a drink with someone for occasional purposes. B when will it go back the last time it happened? C about eight months ago, it was the last time I went there to get a beer with someone. Let's see probably less than a foot of a living wilder. It was in Green Lake in Washington and I was behind our house and this wilderie was walking on the ground, and I started to signal, and he came to about one foot of me. And. And the only reason he left, my father rolled in the aisle and it made noise and the deer fled. I was at a distance from him, and I didn't really know if I should have caressed him or not. But I was about to do so. B ok. I think I asked everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. C thank you. Bye. She is pretty cool for a knot.

"A therapy like this instead of a living human, it will put all the MFT to bankruptcy. No, I think it's good. Sometimes I think people could speak to a stranger. Better or more open than too. If he is someone who could simply judge you questions or train opinions. If it is a virtual human being, it could also be a little less biased. Yeah, exactly. I think it's a great idea. Or you can sit at home and do it instead of going to an office. Exactly. B Very well, so I'm going to start all the recording and then I will do it. In fact, now it is. Okay, great. So now she's going to have a conversation with you. She will ask you a few questions. When she has finished, she will let you know. And I'm going to let you get the doorbell so that you can let me know when you are all finished. Thank you very much. B Thank you. How can I know that she will say the end of the session or. All right. Okay, cool. Thank. B So I'm going to do something to sink our machine. But I will also have to take a fabric because I realize that you have gum in your mouth. A OH, I'm sorry. B No, it's okay. Here. We don't have a trash can. Oh, here, I have a cup. If you don't mind, I'm going to throw. One step at all. Perfect. B who worked. Sorry about it. B no, no, no. How would you know? My fault. Okay, now we are ready to leave. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? A I am. B ok. So how are you today? R I feel pretty good. I am well awake. I had a good breakfast and a good cup of coffee and I have an easy day today. So I'm just going to chat with you. Then I go to the gymnasium and do a few shopping, therefore. So I intend to have a good day today. I was born and I grew up in Los Angeles and I am one of the few inhabitants here. I went to school, but I am one of the rare natives in Los Angeles. B really? Yes, I am. B What are the things you really like at the? A like time. Having owned a holiday home in another condition that I found too hot and humid in Florida. I love time here. I like culture, I like diversity, I like familiarity, I like the beaches. But I also like it just an hour and a half Far, you can go to the desert, let's say Palm Springs, Palm Desert, but also another hour and a half, two hours by road, you can go to the arrow head or a large bear and make snowboarding or skiing or things like that. And I think it's an ideal place to live. B I see what you mean. A thank you. B What are the things you don't really like at it? A well, more may more some of the things I don't like in Los Angeles or say California in general, say as the high tax rate, that the tax rate is up to 13 points now, which will drive out the business here. Also the regulations. I own a small business, so all regulations clearly affect companies. Many of my peers have moved their businesses to Texas, Arizona, Nevada, etc. Some of the other western states that are less regulated, it is a big problem here. California is really the case. Most people do not understand it, but it is also, you know, in addition to high taxes, you know, there is a big problem of immigration that was born and raised here, most people do not see that. But it is a strong tax on the social services system and that is what makes our taxes so high until they really get the borders and get it. So it's, you know, but people don't really seem to want to manage, face it. But that clearly affects companies because of all other things, which is why our taxes are so high and people leave the state. B I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? A like to travel. I went to 66 countries and I do not travel as much as before, but I have traveled a little and I learned a few languages ​​and I surfed. I'm sorry, I didn't really understand your question when you said that? I do not think you have understood what I said, but I will simply go back and I was through Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, South America, North Africa and I appreciate this. I appreciate hot climates now, especially where you can go and relax where there is hot water to surf because cold water makes my back struggle. I also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and train and I try to eat healthy and it is a large part of my life. B I would love to hear about one of your trips. An Oh of course. One of my favorite trips of all time was that I was used to it, when I was younger, see how many countries I can do in a relatively short period, for example in three or four weeks. But about 10 years ago, we went to Paris and stayed for about a week D really knew the city. Even if I went there about 10 times. We really known the city, which was great. Really lived as a room and rented a small apartment and cooked and has made our own stores. But after being there so many times, I really never stayed more than three or four days. It was fun to stay there for about a month and really learn the city. It was fun even if I grew up in Los Angeles. I grew up by taking French, which was not a large Spanish -speaking population when I was younger. So my mother insisted that we all take French people, even if the Spaniard would have been much more precious. But I took French throughout primary school, the first cycle of secondary and high school, so it was pleasant to practice my Frenchman even if I do not remember much and even if I spoke French with the French, you know, my accent is not the biggest. So, after a few sentences, they start talking to me English. What have you studied at school? I have a few different degrees. I was an adult in naval sciences as the first cycle and it was fun. I also have a master's degree in economics and I have a crisis management diploma. B What has decided to do this? R I found them interesting and it was something I wanted to do. Where I went to university. I went to the Naval Academy. I went there to play sports and I found it really interesting to be from southern California, going to the Maryland school. I originally went to be a doctor, but once you start going to school a little, you change your mind, and this. B Do you still work in there? A I am actually in the wholesale trade now. We are wholesale of furniture products and it was a family business, but I went to work there several years ago when my grandfather recently died. So I sort of mounted a family business of 80 years and it is quite interesting. I like him to have grown around him, but it is different from the other jobs I have had in the past. B What is your dream work? A job probably my dream work. I think it's fun. I changed so much. I like to cook and stay at home and I would likely like to stay at home and raise children. I have a daughter and I couldn't spend as much time with her when she was younger than I would have liked. But I think I would be better than saying many women I know who want to work. I really like to cook and hang around in the house and take care of the children I love and Alw AYS part -time. But it seems that it would be fun to stay at home and do that. Having worked roughly for most of my life, so it will probably never happen. But that seems to me that it would be fun. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? R I think I am generally more reserved and shy with foreigners. But when I know someone or I feel comfortable, I think I'm more extroverted. While more foreigners might think that I am more introverted. But I think that when I feel comfortable with some people and I don't know what it is, I can meet a stranger and be completely confident or people that I could have known for years of a personal or commercial situation and be more introverted. I'm just going with the dynamics. But I think my external manifestation is to be a little more shy. Generally, I like to use the reserved term. B ok. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? An Oh Wow is a great idea. I had this on one of my. I have several computers at home and it was also one of my screen savings. I generally tend when I need to relax or have a stressful day or stressful personal events, I usually find exercise, whether yoga or walk or walk or gymnasium or go to the beach, maybe surf or time is hot. I no longer surf in cold weather because it does. It gives me a brain gel. Even if I have been surfed for over 30 years, I generally find that the exercise helps me to relax the best. Or sometimes just light on the sofa in front of the TV, I find it very relaxing. But I like this screen saver. I had this on one of my screen saver at home. B it's great. A yes, that was all. But this is one of the things that took me several years to master, my relaxation skills. I probably didn't have them the best in my twenties, but over the years, I think I have improved with them. I think it's a key thing. And I think that as we mature, when we learn to do it, I would like to learn to do it and be a little more. Had not had these skills earlier. B How are you going to control your temperament? R I like to think that I am pretty good. I think I am much better as well as I have aged. You know, I am more likely to think before talking now, when I say 20 years ago, I was more likely to act before thinking, so I could have said more than me in a time Touration, whether a personal or work situation. But I never had a violent character. But I would have a temperament where I fly from the handle instead of taking a deep inspiration and really thinking about it. I think I'm much better now than I said in adolescence or in the twenties. So I think a lot happens. I think the keyword is maturity. B when will you go back the last time you argue with someone? A OH, WOW. You know, I really had no arguments with anyone in many. What I would consider as a traditional argument, probably my ex-wife. A few years ago, we had an argument mainly above my daughter. It was nothing violent, but it was heated. Just essentially one of the reasons why we did not get married. Our values ​​are so different. Our ideas of parenting and life vision were so different. I think it led us to make heads, but it was right. I do not know if I would call this an argument, but it was more of one of them agree to disagree. B How did you feel at that time? R I felt like I was talking to a wall and I actually felt more angry with myself than I should have learned earlier in life, this boy, before getting married to someone, to have children with them, it is the kind of discussions that people should usually have. But you don't really think about it because sometimes when we are younger, we look at the boy, how that. I looked super on paper and she looked super on paper. But I am quite easy to live and I have different ideas on the education of children how she did. And it was no longer that she was wrong and that I was right, not that I was right and that she was wrong. It was just that we were raised and just different opinions and we never really discussed these things, but these are really fundamental reasons for the reason why we put heads and we were not really a good match. While other things looked good, you know, on paper to both of us. B tell me about a situation you want you to manage differently. A hmm. There is one recently. My father died recently. THANKS. And really, because in our religion, you plan a funeral very quickly, generally in a few days, and I really invited only very, very close friends and family members. I was more or less in a way in charge. My father was remarried, but his widow was not really up to it, so I took care of it. And I would like to have invited one. I kept him very private and I really told people after the fact that he knew it would have liked Come to the service and be known about it. So, I really invited only because of time pressure, really just a handful of people. But now, over time, I would like to invite more of his friends instead of only two or three close friends, 10 or 20 acquaintances and people he knew in business or over the years, and even members of the distant family. I just said it afterwards. I really didn't invite them because I was under time pressure, but I could easily have done it by e-mail or. It is difficult to call everyone personally, but I want it to be something that people have expressed a little. They were angry with me when the other members of my family threw everything to me. Oh, you didn't tell me that after the fact that such or also. B SO. So, they all threw me on it because I did it more or less. So I would like to have done it differently, but I did my best at the time, so I'm not really angry with myself. This is something for which I should probably have been more prepared too, because it was something that was going to happen, was inevitable. B I see. Tell me about your relationship with your family. A well, my two parents have recently died in the past two years, and I had a brother that I have three brothers, one of whom died in December. And we are not very close. Like, I'm still. As I look at other families, we never liked this painting of Norman Rockwell because we are all so different. And I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with the family. Not that it is tense, but I would like it to be more like a boy, one of those families who gathered on Sunday and dinner and all that. We have never done this because we are all so different. Yeah, it's. Yeah, just being. It's like that. But, you know, to foreigners, most people say, Howdy, family. Everyone is great, but I think each family has their own kind of thing. B Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? One no, but I probably thought I could have already had it by other events in my life, and I was just not sure. I had gone into therapy in the past, just from, you know, I was in the army, and I never really sure I know if it was exactly what it was, but I think I work quite well. But I was just not sure I went to therapy and advice over the years. B Why did you decide to enlist in the army? A I did not enlighten. I was an officer. I went to one of the service academies. How did you join the army? 17. made one after high school and I went to a service academy. It is therefore more prestigious. Just don't get some. It's hard. Where I went is the most difficult school in America. B You were very young, right? R I was almost the same age as everyone who went there. B Have you ever seen fights? R we did. 1983. B Can you tell me about it? R right, it was nothing intense. We were right there. We were right. We were not allowed to transport ammunition. Our positions were just dissected at the time and toxic gas was sprayed over us. So it was. It was nothing too intense. It was a lot. Because the service in which I was, the training is much more intense than any real combat situation. B Why? R it's because they form you well. It is as if you are drawing stronger than you play if you are an athlete, if you play football, you train stronger than you play in the game. The same thing with if you are in a combat unit. B How did the army service change you? To that made me more patriotic, having grown up in California, where people were from all over the country and I was able to meet us. While most, let's say, my friends who grew up in the rich Los Angeles as I have never really left and met many Americans and people from different backgrounds and to become more patriotic and a deeper feeling of pride in the country. While you really don't grow with it in southern California. While someone from Texas or Kentucky or Tennessee or Georgia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana grows with this kind of pride. So I thought it was good. Unlike so many of my friends that they do not know that there is a life between Malibu and Manhattan. B What did you do after the army? R I went to my diploma. I was still in the reserves, but I went to higher education and I obtained two graduate diplomas and I went to work in private companies. I didn't care that I joined the fire service. I was a firefighter and paramedical paramedic for several years. And then after having divorced, it was more difficult to make the situation of the guard with my daughter. So I went to work in a family business. It's about my career in a word. B How easy for you to go back to civilian life? R at the beginning, it was difficult because I just had such an impact on my buttocks of the way I walked, I talked. And again, I was an officer. You were very regimated on how you dressed in your private time. It was more difficult. It took me a while to be able to return to Los Angeles Because it was so different. I think I manage it better than most. I have a stronger personality, but it was a great experience. B is good. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? To everything depends. If I do the exercise regularly and I don't eat too late and things are going well in my life, I usually sleep quite well. Even if I may have to get up and go to the toilet once during the night now. But I generally sleep. I usually sleep quite well. B How have you been feeling lately? R I feel pretty good lately. You know, I'm like anyone else. More blue periods in your life, but in recent months, I feel good. B Have you noticed these changes in your behavior or your thoughts lately? One no, not really. I think I seem a little happier, more content lately. B ok. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? A maybe I thought in the past because I have a family story and you know, it was nothing real too debilitating that I did not really work by myself. But I care about it and I looked for advice. I do. I was really against in the past and until my departure. I mean, I would have liked to go more, let's say during my wedding, during my life now. I think it's very useful. However, in the past, I was part. I grew up when I heard that it was just ridiculous and that it was a waste of money, etc. But I think it's a useful tool if you are open. B What made you ask for help? A just questions I wanted. Just an honest opinion outside of friends or foreigners, a professional, you know, life, relationships and sometimes it's good to speak with a professional. Even if I wouldn't see someone like you in real life. I prefer someone who is older than me, a little more life experience than someone who may be younger. B I understand. A SO. But yes, I think it's a useful tool and I really made a change at 180 degrees. B you are still going to therapy now? R I'm not going now. In a way, I take a break. But I'm not against it. If I have problems that I want to bounce back, I have someone I can go. B ok. One yeah. B How did a therapist affect you? R I think it's nice. You know, they are really. If you will see someone who is good. And again, I went to a few different people that I somehow bought. They really don't tell you what to think, which, I think, is great. You know, it's still in the past. They just help you talk about your thoughts and you R feelings and let you decide for yourself, but bring a little clarity to the situation. This is why I like to talk to someone who has much more life experience. And I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman of this kind than, let's say, to a man. But I think it's a useful tool. I had good ideas and it's good to bounce certain things. Totally. Someone who is impartial and who is not in your daily life instead of talking to a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you. But sometimes bouncing the people from a stranger is good. B tell me about the last time you. One was really happy this morning. I know it's weird, but I'm clearly someone and I say it's a joke to my friends, family and associates. I have it clearly. I have an easy day today because I knew that we had a good weather and I had a lot of races and I have clearly a seasonal emotional disorder, but I woke up so happy today when I know that it is 80 degrees and when the weather is beautiful, I am generally much happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and cold where I am always. I know this term. But I woke up really happy today because I know it's going to be a nice day and I can't wait to feel the sun. B How would your best friend describe you? Most of my friends, I am sort of a man of the Renaissance. I know a few subjects a little. Too smart for my good. And I am. I know a lot about a lot. I am quite rational. I am very ingenious. People always call me when they have problems and I help them talk to them or I am full of resources and tell them where to go, whether it is where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or, you know, I am great with medical diagnoses and you know, people also say that I am very fun and fun to be with it and I also have it. I don't have many gray areas. People really love me or don't like me. With me, things are roughly black and white. I am what I am. I don't bs. I am the opposite of a politician. So I'm not telling people what they want to hear. I am not rude, not rude with anyone. But I’m almost calling things as I see them. So it's about no, not really. Because I do everything with tact. B ok. R I like to think that I do. B is there something you regret? A I want I probably spent more time with my parents before I passed, but I was busy. I would probably like to have been able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger, but just a large part is very typical. B What advice would you give ourselves 10 or 20 years ago? A truly to think a little more, be a little less impulsive. I pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than now. I think that's it. And I looked at things in the long term instead of looking at things in the short term. When you make decisions or choices. B What are you the most proud in your life? R I am proud of my daughter. She is a beautiful young woman. I am proud of my public service. I have never really done a job for money. Of my military service and my fire services. There are very few people like me who did it, who had the history in the education I made. But I like the public service, so I'm proud of it. I am proud of all the certificates that I hung on my walls at home in degrees, a bit like trophies. I am proud to have been able to stay in very good physical shape over the years and hit wood and maintain good health. B ok. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. It was nice to meet you. B Goodbye. A Bye bye. THANKS. How was I? Fantastic. B oh, I'm sorry.

"A good. B I saw my hair. You see what you look like and you are, oh, my God, I look terrible. So, is this image not at all based on a real woman? One no, they used. It is not based on a real person, but they. We go there. Okay, so when it is finished, I will just wait for a flash in our system because the button does not work, and I will come back to get you. B ok. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. It's still in the morning. So where do you come from? I come from the east coast. Massachusetts. A really? B yes. When did you move to the? B I moved to Los Angeles when I was a child with my parents. Almost had no choice in this area. How often do you go back to your hometown? B I did not go back. The last time I was back, three years ago for Christmas. How does he compare himself to the? B is very agitated and stapled. There are a lot of angry people and many people don't care about the other person. Here to the, in which. Back to the East. The east coast, the model of reflection is very different. You know your neighbors, you are friendly with your neighbors and for anyone you see in the street. SO. Yeah. How is you easy to get used to living in Los Angeles? B Well, since I was a child. I was quite young at the start, it was tough. I was in trouble in school, but after all that exceeded. I did well in high school and all that and I even took university courses. A it's good. What are the things you really like? B well, I love the beach and I love the mountains. I like to hike and I like to walk along the beach. I just live in a few beach houses, so it's easy. A beautiful. I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B No, not at all. One why? B is simply not interested. I went to Mexico several times when I was younger, I went to Ensenada, but other than that, I am not interested in leaving the United States, in particular with what is happening lately, abroad. A good. What are you studying at school? B In fact, children's psychology. And I was in the nursing program for a little, but I had Problems at home that made me give up. R I'm sorry to hear that. B oh, it's true. A like my work. You could almost say that it is practically made for me. What is your dream work? B I don't have one. To be honest, I admire people who do the work they love. I mean, like football players. They like to play football and they are paid all this money. How great is it? So, do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I'm quite out. When I meet someone, at the beginning, I could be a little reserved because we all, when we meet someone, go to a judgment if we want to continue to communicate with the person or not. But once I decided that I like this person or something else, I talk a lot. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. B yes. What are you doing to relax? B I like to watch movies. I liked to read, but lately, my level of concentration has not been so great, so it is difficult to participate in a good book. How are you going to control your temperament? B not good. Sometimes I have an explosion from time to time. It depends on the anger I am angry. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B yesterday. And it was with my partner. And in fact, to be honest, I don't remember what it was. It's just that sometimes people can have a ugly attitude and I don't appreciate it. And if I feel that I am lacking in respect or, in my opinion, I will defend myself. Did that cause you to trouble? B Sometimes some people can be extinguished from my personality because. Very obstinate and I say what I think. I. I will not deliberately injure people's feelings or anything of this nature. But I will not be intimidated and I will not be done. I will not back down if I feel like I am challenged. SO. A good. Tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B last year, my mother died, so I would like to have managed this differently. R is it uncomfortable for you to talk about it? B It upsets me, so I'm sorry. It's good. To Tell Me on the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. B Let me see. I think I will also transmit that one because it will upset me. More. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B it's terrible. Sometimes falling asleep may not be a problem, especially when you have finished working and doing everything you have to do in a day. You are tired. But. But staying asleep is a whole DIF Do Thing for me because it's like I can't. I get up and then I am awake. I'm going to go out in the living room, turn on the television and watch TV. I'm lucky if I take three to four hours of sleep. Are they triggered by something? B Maybe, because I have a lot of mind, you know, thinking of the invoices and stress of work and. And all these other things. So it's probably a large part of this. Who seems really difficult. B It is not difficult. It's just frustrating because when your mind goes into overtime mode, that. This affects everything. Your concentration, your sleep, your diet, everything. SO. What do you like when you don't sleep well? B a little grumpy, especially in the morning. I am not a person in the morning. I like the nights, but I don't like in the morning. It's like, leave me alone until I take my first cup of coffee. So other than that, I'm fine. Well, I have been depressed for some time and I have always had difficulty. Difficulty because after my mother's death, four months later, my uncle died. So I had two dead last year. So I'm still in shock and try to get back together. Most recently, I started to pursue the interests that I made that I have not done for a year because of what happened. A it's good. It's good. Have you noticed changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B just. I could get angry a little more easily. I sleep a lot. I eat, I eat too much. I get tired very easily because I don't sleep much. So sometimes it's difficult. It seems that I find it hard to spend the day. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B yes. I have a psychiatrist who regularly prescribes drugs to me. Oh. I was diagnosed a certain time ago, probably 10 to 15 years ago. And that's just something I never understood. I don't know if you can or not. So I always took the medication. What made you ask for help? B I was talking to everyone, my family, my friends and things like that. And I felt desperate and desperate. And I had tried to take my life years ago, which made me hospitalize. And then they started to treat me. I started to see a therapist. A goes to a therapist who helps you. B Well, right now, I'm not going to a therapist because my insurance, they will cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist. But I work with one of my friends who know avenues to ask for help for a therapist. And I don't know if it will really help me. I. I mean, sometimes it depends on this kind of therapist you get. Sometimes people are sitting there and they just listen to you to speak and walk, and you think, my God, what is it for? And the other type is the type that will give you a kind of feedback on how to manage emotions. Tools to help you manage your emotions. A change. Have you noticed since you have been in therapy? B As I said, I did not go to therapy recently, just psychiatrists, just medication. There was no change, really. I would probably do well because I managed very well before my mother's death. I was his caregiver. And even if I felt overwhelmed or lacked patience with her, I was always much happier than now. SO. A good. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B I would say when my son was born years ago. R Do you find easy to be a parent? B I am no longer a parent. He died, and it was also difficult. Do you know that you are some of your best qualities? B I am extremely organized, extremely reliable. My work loves me because I do everything I am supposed to do, even if sometimes I feel a little dispersed. And, you know, these qualities are admirable in people who can hold ones and be responsible. A it's great. Is there anything you regret? B Excuse me? Is there something you regret? B oh, I have a lot of regrets. Things I have done in the past that I am not too happy with. But, you know, I met someone once in my life who had this saying, and you see it on a bumper sticker, live to never regret. So you know, you cannot go back and make changes. It is too late. So why, do you know, to dwell on the situation? But sometimes it's much easier to say than to do, right? What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B I am not the advice in a way so that you have a person, you know, I do not give my friends any advice. I mean, I find most of the people mostly don't listen to you anyway, so why bother? I'm just saying my opinion, that's all. What are the things you want to change about you? B Well, at the moment, I'm with a diet because of my overeating after my mother's death. I was much thinner when she was alive. I went crazy with food and slept a lot, you know, sleep, eat, sleep, eat. And so now I'm a bit like in a diet that tries to lose this weight because it's very unhealthy for me. To Tell Me on something you recently did that you really enjoyed. B trying to think. He It's been a long time. In fact, there is really nothing because now I keep my mind occupied. I haven't been in a film for ages. I don't know. I used to shop all the time. I don't do it now. So it was. It's been a while that I am not happy and satisfied with who I am and what I am doing in my life right now. To tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B My weekends, as on Saturday, I generally work. Sunday is usually a day of cleaning. You know, do your laundry, clean the house, shop, shop for food, you know, that kind of thing. So it's not. If I was younger, you know, it would be fun, you know, be in club or other. But I'm too old for that now. A proud of your life. B really? I can't think anything. There is nothing that I can be proud of. What are the things that usually put you in a good mood? B a good. Like comedy or something else. I like to look at that sometimes my partner could do something stupid, what I like because I like to make fun of them. But that's it, you know, maybe go out for a walk on the beach. That's it. One everything I need. B ok. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. B No problem. THANKS. A farewell. B bye. Does anyone speak for her or. She really talks to me. To it is his voice. I. I will in fact explain how she works. Once we have finished the study. B We can talk more about it.

B Uh, very well. A That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Um, well, I didn't argue with a real person. A Can you say a little more about that? B Yes. I have a person that I hear once in a while and I talk to them and I had an argument about them listening on my phone. A Okay. What do you do when you're annoyed? B Avoidance. Whatever annoys me. Being homeless. A Wow, that sounds really hard. B Yes, it was. Well, they don't particularly like homeless people in la. So it was. It's really hard if you're homeless. Oh, right now I live in an apartment. A How do you like your living situation? B I don't. I don't like the neighbors. Well, they harass you all the time so I don't come out of the apartment. A That sucks. Could you have done anything to avoid it? B Well, I didn't know when I moved there that they were horrible people. And I've complained to management but they don't do anything about it. They just tell me to move. A Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? B Yes. Back in the 90s. A What got you to seek help? B Crying all the time? Yeah. Yes. Yes. I was in the hospital two months ago for 15 days. A Tell me more about that. B I was in there for depression, for arguing with a person. That's not real. A What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going here? B I ignore the person when I hear them. It's not hard anymore. It was before I was going to therapy. Oh. It's helped me be more cheerful and ignore things that bother me. Sleeping all the time, eating too much, arguing, screaming at this unreal person before I found out. No. A How have you been feeling lately? B Lately I've still been pretty depressed. A Do you feel that way often? B Yes. A How easy is it for you to. B Very hard. Well, I wake up about every two hours to go to the bathroom or some noise wakes me up so I don't sleep well. Now I'm tired all the time. A When was the last time you felt really happy?

A What's the best thing about being a parent? B The kids. They're great. A What's the hardest thing about being a child? B Trying to get them to do the right thing. Trying to get them to stay in school. A Do you find it easy to be a parent? B No. A Tell me more about that. B Well, you try to do the right thing and it doesn't always work out. A There are always trade offs in life, aren't there? B Yes. A How close are you to your family? B Oh, well, pretty close. What I think of today's kids. Oh, they're just like any other kids.

"A Okay. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Yes. B Okay. So how are you doing today? A I'm doing good. B That's good. Where are you from originally? A Los Angeles. Really? B What are some things you really like about la? A Convenience. Convenience. Things you don't really like about LA people. The crowd. Traffic people. Not lack of respect. B Yeah, I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? A Locally? Regionally. B Cool. What do you enjoy about traveling? A Meeting old people. I love talking to old people. B I'd love to hear about all your trips. A I work a lot with my elders on my reservation and other reservations here in California, and I spend a lot of time with the elders. I talk with them and they help me out a lot. So I get to hear good stories. B That's so good to hear. What's one of your most memorable experiences? A Going in the mountains and seeing waterfalls that no one else had seen except for my people. That was the most beautiful thing I think I found. B Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A It depends on the situation. If somebody comes to me looking for me to help them, I take control. But if I need help, it's. I work at asking for help. So it depends on the situation. B That makes sense. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? A I garden and I paint. B Nice. How are you at controlling your temper? A I'm very good at it. B That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? A Three days ago? It was about communication. It was the lack of communication on the other person's part. And I needed them to communicate better so that way I could understand they didn't communicate. So we had an argument and I got it settled. I felt caught off guard because this is an individual that I spend pretty much almost every minute of my day with. And to not be told what was going on in this person's head and then to have a situation arise and I was kept out. I didn't like that. B A situation that you wish you would handle differently. A I'D rather pass. B Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? A Probably the lack of time spent with my grandparents. Is this. When they're gone, you regret that you didn't miss time with spend time with them. One thing I truly wish I could remember, I was a professional athlete at one time. I had partied till like four in the morning and then I had did my event at like 10 o'clock in the morning and I was my team captain and I embarrassed my whole team. And that's one thing I truly regret. I was a professional fighter. So yeah, I not party thought about other people besides myself. B I see. What'd you study at school? A I studied massage therapy. I got my nursing degree and a lot of it's just been on job education. B How close are you to them? A Very close. Due to my own injuries, just going through the therapy process and believing in people and seeing how it worked and I decided to do that. I wanted to help people too. B Are you happy you did that? A Oh, yeah. B Are you still working in that? A Yes. B What's your dream job? A I want to paint. That's all I want to do is just paint. B Awesome. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. A I have two sons and it's tight for me to. To move on. And they're older and they can take care of themselves now. So me leaving the area where my sons are, it's pretty hard. B Do you find it easy to be a parent? A Yeah. B What's the best thing about being a parent? A A reflection of you. The reflection of you reminds you so much about yourself, who you are. B What's the hardest thing about being a parent? A Consistency. Even when you're sick. Being consistent. B What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? A I don't assume my kids are right or wrong. I listen to them first. They make my decisions after that. And I try not to come from an emotional heightened place. But I think logically and I put myself in their place before I do it. We discuss. We communicate heavy in my family because that's the only way we get along with each other is through communication. So communicate. B Tell me about your relationship with your family. A My family is severed pretty much. So my family, my relationship with my family on the reservation, it's very tight. The rest of the family were all fragmented and scattered around the Southwest, so it's not very tight at all. B Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? A I have too many to count. Start with my uncle. My uncle was like My dad, he raised me in a good way. He watched out for me. He told me he taught me hard work at a very young age. He also taught me to protect my family and taught me honor. Taught me love. He's a good man. B That's great. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? A I don't know. I haven't had a good night's sleep in years. Sorry. I get broken Sleep. Dreams. The dreams become too real. B How do you cope with them? A Get up and go to the bathroom and go back to sleep? I try to. B Are they triggered by something? A My years of fighting, just. It caught up to me. B What are you like when you don't sleep well? A Reserved. Reserved. And I try to find things to distract my brain, to think of different ways of doing things. B Like what? A Well, I got rid of TV about eight months ago, so I got rid of that distraction. So what I do now is I either paint a garden or cleaning house, washing dishes, or get out and go walk. That's another thing, too. Do a lot of walking nowadays. B That's good. How have you been feeling lately? A Anxious. A lot of anxieties. But it's good. I have techniques to bring myself down. B Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? A Um, nothing new out of the normal. B Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? A Yes. B How long ago were you diagnosed? A Uh, three years ago, around there. Three. B What got you to seek help? A Insomnia issues. B Do you still go to therapy now? A It was about two years ago, around there. 2. A little bit over two years ago, I was released from therapy. B Why did you stop? A The therapist released me. B Okay. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? A What I noticed is I still deal with pictures and emotions, but what I do is now I really practice hard at taking care of myself and getting to those places. The things that strike me, that get me anxious or excited or angry. I learned how to work out of it and realize it's not real. It's not not real. It's just the emotion. It's not real. So these are the things, like little mantras that I tell myself. And this has really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren't real. So therapy has helped a lot. I mean, it's just. It's changed my world. B Have you been diagnosed with depression? A Yes. B How long ago were you diagnosed? A Around the same time as the ptsd. Around three years ago. B Do you have disturbing thoughts? A In my Dreams. When I dream, I do. B When was the last time that happened? A Last night. B Can you tell me about that? A I was just dreaming of fighting and then preparing fighters to fight. That was another thing too. I build up anxiety. Dreaming about preparing fighters to fight and then stepping in front of thousands of people. And then I always end up fighting in my dreams. So it's always what gets me scared in all my dreams is that I should have made the move and finished the fight and I didn't. And so it builds anxiety and stress in me. Then I tend to act out of my sleep. B How did you feel in that moment? A Like it was real. Like I was there. Like I smell, taste, feel everything. There. I was there. B That sounds really hard. A Yeah. B Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. A This morning, driving here, talking to my girlfriend. B How would your best friend describe you? A Trustworthy. He loves me, I love him. We're best friends. B That's so good to hear. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? A I have zero to change. B Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. A I can't recall. B Okay. Is there anything you regret? A Regret? Just not spending time with my grandparents and I think day to day issues, maybe, you know, a couple here, there, that I should have went to the store first or something like that, but I mean, it's nothing like that. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A Quit thinking you know it all. Yeah. B What would you say are some of your best qualities? A My loyalty, My trustworthiness. B Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. A Started a new art project yesterday. It was nice. B Can you tell me about that? A Well, we were in Santa Barbara and we found some rocks, some old rocks that someone had made a pile of and just threw a dump of old rocks out of the way. And I went through the pile of rocks and I found this old rock that was in the middle of it and I took it home and now I'm doing an art piece on it. And for me it was like this thing was totally forgotten about. It was just considered a rock. And now potentially it'll be sitting at my grandkids table. To me, that's really cool. I like that. B Awesome. What are you most proud of in your life? A Starting something that I'm so bad at that I don't think there's no way I can be good at it. And all of a sudden I get to be better at it to where I don't even have to think about it. Just so good at it. That way, I can just touch it and feel it and I don't have to think about it. These are the things that I'm proud of. Like, I like that. I like that accomplishment, I guess you can say. B Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. A Goodbye. Her left clavicle needs adjustment. Her clavicle sits higher. It makes her look like she's been in a car accident. She's like this. Her left shoulder is up higher and it squares pushed in, so you're off. And it's drawing my attention to that. So I don't know if you guys noticed that too. The other part of it, too, is the hand motions that she does. Some of the hand motions are very aggressive in the wake. So it was very distracting in the beginning because she was, like, fast moving. Like, my therapist, because we were working with the PTSD issues, he did everything slowly because I set off on quick trick, good movements. And so, like, with her hand movements like that coming out like this, talking, it was distracting in the beginning. But besides that, everything is just like. It's pretty. I mean, it's a computer, but it's. I mean, you feel comfortable. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. B I'm really glad to hear that. A Thank you.

I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B Yeah, it's perfectly good. A good. So how are you today? B I feel good. It's early in the morning. I have no school. I'm excited. Born and raised in Los Angeles, California. A really? What are the things you really like? B the fact that you can surf, snowboarding and, like doing two radically different things in one day. What are the things you don't really like at it? B coming from the districts in which I lived, I would say that the population of lower socioeconomic backgrounds, is like a sump almost for young African Americans. And it sucks. Yeah, I see what you mean. I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B not really. I went to New York, Connecticut, Mexico and Texas, but quite young. What do you like in travel? B especially, if I travel by plane, just the view in the air. It's amazing. It's remarkable. To I would love to hear about one of your trips. B The first time I went to New York, I was about 11 years old and I made sure I had the seat of the window on the plane and the feeling of taking off is just exhilarating. But we left at night here in Los Angeles and it was the next day in New York. It was therefore a little confusing to get used to the time change. And the first thing I remembered was to have a slice of pizza in New York, and it was delicious. A beautiful. B yep. What are you studying at school? B Graduated with the Baccalaureate in communication so that I can enter the army as an officer. What decided you to do this? B In fact, what is it, what? I don't know. It is as if you should have a plan and it is the only thing that has just been put in place. And it seems that it will be set up for me. What is your dream work? B to be honest, a job that does not exist. However, this is that you can be paid to do. Nothing. Yeah, but probably. I was really shy when I was a child, but I grew up in myself thanks to the experience of the college. I'm much more frank, it's great. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not haw Aii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I write music and I especially train. So, if I feel stressed, I just make a set of pumps and I lift weights. How are you going to control your temperament? B I'm pretty good. I saw a therapist when I was a child for about a year and I don't know, it taught me to be able to control my emotions. And I don't think I do it in the best way because when I am angry, I decide to simply put my emotions instead of letting them go out in their appropriate outlet. Did that cause you to trouble? B not really. It's more an interpersonal thing I don't know. A good. When will you go back the last time you argued with someone? What was it? B probably yesterday. Something with regard to sports. The playoffs are lit, so things like that. Of this nature. To tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B um, so much, I suppose. During my last year of high school, I waited until the last minute to apply for UC schools and it did not succeed because I could not return to the applications. And I'm sure I would have been admitted. So it sucks. But hey, tell me about the hardest part. A decision that you have never had to make. B This is an intriguing question. I actually have no idea. A good, tell me about Neven or something like that. Something you want to be able to erase from your memory. B The death of my grandmother. Can you tell me? B of course. My grandmother died at the age of 11. She raised me since the moment I was born because my mother could not take care of myself. She raised my sister, my brother and my cousin too and her five children. So she was the matriarch of our family and the closest thing I had to a mother. It was difficult, but it's going to be seven years old in May 30, and I grew up a lot. More tears. A Tell Me on your relationship with your family. B I am a child with foster family, so I was emancipated from the Foster program about two years ago now. But my immediate family, I am quite close with them and I see them as much as possible. And my host family, they are great. I have known them since the age of five, so it was pretty cool. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B fairly easy. I fall asleep fairly quickly. It is not a problem, except when my back hurts me. So it's a problem. A little bad mood in the morning. I guess I drive more aggressively. A little stressed by some problems I can take care of, but I shouldn't be S because I can do something or I can't. This is how things work. Can you tell me? B of course. I have some parking tickets. No parking. They do not make violations, but they are tickets. And I did not know if you miss the court without being in the hospital or in prison, that you may not be excused for not having taken the hearing date. So I had three failures to appear in court, the sucking. Tickets that are thousands of dollars and I have no money. So I don't know. It's quite difficult to manage when you try to do something in your life. But there are so many barriers and obstacles which, as, you have not planned. So I don't know. It sometimes becomes stressful and. Yeah. How to face it for periods? Some days I am sitting and I am just lost in my thoughts. And I don't really communicate to anyone because there is nothing that no one can do for me, really. So I just bottle it like I do everything. How difficult? B not very. After doing it so long, it becomes a natural thing, I think. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B HMM. Really happy. Why is it such a difficult question? I don't know. I'm pretty happy with everything right now. I do not know extreme happiness. Every day is the same day. It looks like. A good. Tell me about something you have done recently that you really enjoyed. B soaked on the other side of the street at the Clipper Center. There is a basketball court there, and I have been working on it for a while, and I finally got up. A beautiful. B yeah. How do your best friends describe you? B I have four close friends that I have known for over eight years each, and. I don't know. Studious, working hard, determined. I don't know. Yeah. What are the things you want to change about you? B probably my metabolism, on which I don't really have control, so I don't know. I'm quite happy with myself. R When someone made you feel really bad about you? B HMM. I think that in my sixth year, year of primary school, I was not the best of students, but I had a diligent teacher and, as, he failed me throughout the year. But I learned a lot and I developed a passion for school afterwards. It was therefore like a situation that I overcome after being so badly and down. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B the same teacher who m Ade me feels really bad, in fact, because if it was not for sability, I don't think I would have won the discipline to be where I am now at university and everything. It would therefore have been quite influential. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B I remember this time that I was in the desert or to Joshua Tree with my best friend and his father, and we have in fact remained stuck in the mountains and, as, we came down from a ravine and his jeep would not overcome a rock. So it was. It was pretty. Yeah it was. It was a bit weird. I thought I was Superman. I tried to move a rock. I was thousands of books. Did not work. But, yes, we finally came out. We thought we were going to be stuck in the desert, but it was a fun moment. I was able to drive in the desert when I did not have my license, so it was fun. Yeah. R that looks like an excellent situation. B is something that you regret that day or in general? To everything that comes to mind. B other than, like, the UC thing, like, where I have not applied to schools in time. I regret it. Yeah. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B HMM. I don't know. I was 10 years old 10 years ago. I would probably tell myself, I have no idea. This is an interesting question. Being the first in my immediate family is in my mother, my brothers and my sister to go to university. SO. Yeah, it's pretty. Yeah. A good. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. B No problem.

"A Complexion. B Okay, now I'm going to do this thing one more time. So now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. I'm going to put the doorbell back over here. When she's done, she'll let you know and you can hit the doorbell. Okay? A All right. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. Are you okay with this? A Yes. B Okay. How are you doing today? A Very well. B That's good. A New York. This turned the volume up a little bit. B Oh, yeah, sure. Okay. I'll wait here to make sure it's okay. A For a change. That's good. I wanted to la. I wanted to see what Los Angeles was about. B How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? A Probably took a year or two. B Can you tell me about that? A Well, you know, being away from my family, being away from what I was used to in New York, the neighborhoods, the people and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle. Here, the weather can't beat the weather. It's generally always nice. It's not too hot, it's not too cold. It's creative. I do like movies like the beach, the traffic. There's a lot of traffic. Sometimes I think people are a little bit colder here. More distant and unfriendly than other places. B What did you study at school? A I was a history major. B Are you still working in that? A No. B What do you do now? A I do demonstrations in high end supermarkets. To be a screenwriter. That's one of the reasons why I came to Los Angeles. B How hard is that? A It's hard because I don't always maintain focus and motivation. I let other things distract me. B How did you decide to do that? A I've always been interested in films, ever since I was a child. And I just always was writing and had an active imagination. B Do you travel a lot? A In the last. Probably almost 10 years, I've traveled more than I had in the past. Well, I've always traveled. Even as a kid, my parents would travel around. So yes, seeing new places and seeing people that are different than I am. Seeing how they live and taking in the sights. I went to Kenya. That was probably one of the best trips I ever went on. On the safari and just going out in a jeep and seeing wild animals in their own Natural habitat was pretty incredible. B Are you happy you did that? A Oh, yeah. That's one of the great experiences of my life. And I also got to a place in Egypt at the end of that trip called Sharm El Sheikh, which is right on the water. And it has some of the best scuba diving in the world, which is hard to believe that Egypt would. But it was just amazing. I didn't go scuba diving. I went snorkeling. What do I do to relax? I like to listen to music. I like to helping. Watching movies helps me relax because it takes me out of whatever might be on my mind. I do meditate every day. I like to take walks in nature. That's always calming, especially down by the ocean. B That's good. What do you do when you're annoyed? A It depends. Sometimes I get angry and lose my temper. A lot of times I'll do a form of self hypnosis and calm myself, which is something I've recently learned how to do. This is very helpful. And also since I meditate, I don't get annoyed at things as easily as I did in the past. B What are some things that make you really mad? A Some things that make me really mad. I guess things think of injustice in the world or done to people when it doesn't really need to be that way. That we could all get along and make the world better. Last night I went to a movie screening of an independent film and I didn't think it was done very well. It's not so much that we had a fun argument about the movie. So that was like, you know, that just happened yesterday. So that was. That's on my mind. B Okay. Is there anything you regret? A Is there anything I regret? Yeah. There have been opportunities in my life that I wished I had taken them and pursued them, certain jobs, you know. When I first got to Los Angeles, I had an opportunity to become a grip, and I probably should have pursued that. B How did you decide to do that? A How did I decide to do that? I don't really understand the questions. B Let's come back to that later. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A Take advantage of every opportunity that came my way. I think saying yes to any opportunity is very important. And no matter how you feel, you know, you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you want to do. B Have you ever served in the military? A No. B Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? A No. B Have you been diagnosed with depression? A No, but I've been depressed in my life. B How have you been feeling lately? A For the most part, I've been feeling good. Sometimes I feel a little blue. I think sometimes if I allow a regret to come into my mind, that can bring me down. But I can usually get out of it pretty quickly. B Are they triggered by something? A Sometimes financial concerns, sometimes an opportunity. How do I explain it? Financial is one way that I. If I had made another decision, I might have more money or my life would be different. B Have you noticed any changes in your behavior? A Not really. I mean, I feel pretty much the same. What got me to seek help for. Let's come back to that. Well, generally talking to someone has helped. When I did do that. B That's good. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? A Pretty easy. I don't have a problem sleeping. What do you like when you don't sleep well? Usually I'm grumpy. So if I don't sleep well, you know, I feel tired and irritable. B I see what you mean. How would your best friend describe you? A How would my best friend describe me? That's a good question. Well, I'm definitely friendly and outgoing. A little bit secretive, probably that I should be. They'd like to see me more accomplished in attaining my goals and maybe a little happier. B Do you consider yourself an introvert? Do you consider yourself an introvert? A I think it's tough. It depends. Sometimes I'm very introverted because I do like to write. So that takes means that I have to spend time alone. And then when I come out of that, I'm extroverted. So I don't really see myself as one hard way or the other. It all depends on the situation and my mood. B What would you say are some of your best qualities? A My best qualities? I think. I think I'm caring. I think I'm intelligent. I think I'm funny, I'm outgoing. I have a likable personality. People have said that I'm engaging, but not oppressive or overly engaging. There's sort of a cool detachment and creative intuitive. B Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? A Yes. B Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? A Last time I felt really happy, I don't know. I woke up this morning. I was pretty happy. Had breakfast. I was happy. Sun was shining. B That's great. What's one of your most memorable experiences? A I think, like I said, going to Kenya was a memorable experience. I do remember scuba. Snorkeling was a really great experience. I just remember seeing all the colors in the ocean and feeling the sun. Powerful sun. On my back. Almost beyond. Almost beyond human in a way. Just more in touch with everything, the universe. B Wow, that sounds like a great situation. A Yeah, it would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day, but. B I understand. What are you most proud of in your life? A What am I most proud of in my life? I think I've helped people and sometimes when they were in crisis, you know, I've written some screenplays, had some good relationships. B Can you give me an example of. A Good relationships? Just, you know, being connected with someone else, you know, spending time with them and connecting on emotional and physical and mental levels. B Okay. Okay. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? A It could be a song that I hear on the radio. It could be a lot of times looking forward to something. You know, if I'm going to go to a movie, go bowling, hang out with people. You know, looking at work and going to work and feeling productive puts me in a good mood. B That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. A You're welcome. Bye. Bye. B Sometimes she would ask me questions. A Well, sometimes she would ask me, like, it would sort of tweak and then it would ask me this question about. And I was like, I don't remember really kind of getting specific like that. B Oh, like, what do you remember what question you're talking about? A question about, like, seeking therapy. Oh, okay. A Like, kind of asked me, well, you depressed? And I was like, well, sometimes, you know, and then it will explain that. And then it was like, oh, and then it did something. And then it was like, well, you know, did therapy help? And I'm like, wow, we, like, there was no bridge to that conversation. Got it.

And then if you want to knock this door again to let me know. THANKS. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Consider me a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I am a computer. I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. How are you today? GOOD. It's good. Where do you come from? B Colorado. A really? Why did you move to it? B career. Career possibilities. What are you doing now? B parajurist. A great. When did you move to the? B for in -depth training. For the weather? For a friend. How often do you go back to your hometown? B Not often at all now? Every few years. What are the things you really like at? B Time, the beach, sunsets at the beach. Many career possibilities. Group of educated people, sophisticated market. How is you easy to get used to living in Los Angeles? B is an adjustment to come here. Many people have misunderstood her a little. It is a relaxed city, appearing, but it is in fact very sensitive, you know, success and marketing and this kind of thing. So you have to keep up with the pace. One yeah. How difficult is it? B it's a little more difficult. I think that when you make the adaptation for the first time and very soon, it becomes obvious that it is another market that you only have to work hard as you do in others. Who makes sense. What is your dream work? B OH, a lawyer. A really? For what? B oh, just because you have power. You can use skills to be able to affect people's lives in a more dramatic way than being just assistant in this area. A fee. How far are you from your family? B oh, a large part is no longer there to have brothers and sisters outside the state. So not particularly close for the moment. R I'm sorry, what are the things that make you really crazy? B Disstolation, bad, lack of sympathy, insensitivity, do you know? One yeah. How are you going to control your temperament? B Very good. If anything, I am regressive in this way. A it's good. When will go up the last time you argued with some E and what was it? Oh, wow. B oh, just a friend. A friend who is at the moment has fabulous work but who spends too much money that he must save. Uh. A OH. How do you know them? B through a work situation. Just a work connection. How much do you have? B Close. Close. Now we spend time we have. We sometimes go out and we have sometimes having fun. A it's good. What do you like to have to have fun? B a walk, walking on the beach. You know, shopping in the beaches, is somehow on Rodeo Drive on occasion. And see films, art galleries. A good. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B oh, my daughter. An AW. Tell me about your children. B I just have a girl who graduated from the Faculty of Law Ucla and I raised her completely alone without any help, so it seemed to be an AB realization that was worth it. The two jobs and the right work. I say the peer pressure. He can completely change everything a parent tries to put in a child. It's good. One yeah. Can you give me an example? B oh, wow. Yeah. My daughter, to be now a graduate of the Faculty of Law when she was. We kept it in the schools of Beverly Hills and some of these very rich children with very named celebrities families loved the display. She actually was in trouble for that once and not because she was influenced. So it was a very bad time for us. Who seems really difficult. What do you think of today's children? B I think it depends on the neighborhood or the state in which you are. I think they are a little wrong, I think that a little without inspiration at the moment. I think they were increased by the concerns of the wars and. And things like that. And I think they could probably use a common objective, common knowledge, instead of being just a more separate group. Once, I think, you know, a little without inspiration at the moment. Yeah, I see what you mean. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B I sometimes worry, you know, work problems, but it's quite easy, quite easy. Do you often feel this way? B No, I don't feel like I am not sleeping. I worry from time to time for something. A work. When will it go up the last time it happened? B oh, my God, about a few weeks ago. How did you feel at that time? B just, you know, unfortunately we have to worry. Unfortunate. It is not easier. It's just cooperation between people. It solves almost everything, you know, so you always want to have that around you. How are you when you don't sleep? B well, just stressed. Yeah, stressed. A More stressed. It seems really difficult. Do you feel depressed? Fatigue B has a lot of sleep implications, not feeling like you or badly judging things that you could judge differently if you were more stopped. One yeah. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? Not depression. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? Probably. B who was considered the possibility. I had a job trial several years ago and I actually lit it and won sensory regulations, something denounced, implications. And I was a little harassed about this. And so I found it when I got out, I couldn't find a job right away in my field. So I had to go to a different field, return to the UCLA and get a new professional management. And I found myself sometimes fears that it will happen again. You know, something as it would happen. No, I'm sorry to hear that. What made you ask for help? B just that I noticed that. I noticed that I felt very. In my paranium class, I had a section on labor law and there was a very complicated file that I had done with a lot of work and studies for my case. But once faced again in this class framework, I just couldn't do it. It was late. It was a late paper for me and I realized that I was traumatized in front of starting again. Post-traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the death of adrenaline, from what I understand. So I think it struck me later that I had to face this paper again. And wow, no adrenaline, just like, wow, that's still. What were your symptoms? B Extremely avoiding something to do something. It should have been easy for me. And three, thinking as well as I should, by making him study or dissect it, by putting the feeling of browsing this paper, this type of paper, even if it is only a class assignment. R Have you noticed these latest changes in your behavior or your thoughts? B well, not recently, you know, at the time, when it happened, which was about 10 years ago now, it was settled in court about 7 years ago now. And yes, yes, it was effective. It was effective in the way you see almost everything in your confidence and. To this kind of thing. Do you feel that therapy is useful? B I'm sorry, repeat the question. Do you have the impression that therapy is useful? B peaceful. Do I feel peaceful? Well, yes, I was peaceful that it was settled, but angry that it never happened. So it's difficult for everyone probably Never never a Pacific about this question, never. It's always. The mention of this always makes me angry that I had to go through that. One yeah. Could you have done something to avoid it? B I don't think I tried everything to avoid it, you know, and so I think it was aggravating for me too because I am a patient, realistic, and I tried everything to avoid confrontation, whatever. But it was just necessary to try to help me cover the damage to our lives and to the life of us. One yeah. Do you consider yourself introverted? Not now. B maybe once in my life. Not now. If you cannot communicate, you know, if you can communicate, you can overcome people's perceptions and their judgments. If you can effectively explain something and it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself that others could normally have judgments for age or something like that. One yeah. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B just raising an extended girl, you know, or, you know, just the experience of thought that was after all the years that was a success.

"A Okay. Fix my hair. Great. Thank you. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Yes. B Okay. So how are you doing today? A Okay. B That's good. Where are you from originally? A New York. B Really? Why'd you move to la? A To pursue music industry. A job in the music industry. B Are you still working in that? A Yes. B What do you do now? A I'm self employed. B What's. What's your dream job? A To become a music producer. B Awesome. How hard is that? A It's pretty hard. There's a lot of competition. B Why did you move to la? A To pursue a job. B When did you move to la? A When? About a year ago. Last February. B How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? A It was pretty difficult. East coast is a lot different than the west coast. B How often do you go back to your hometown? A I think I've been there twice in the past year. B That's good. Do you travel a lot? A No, I'm more of a creature of habit. B Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? A Yes. B Why? A Sometimes I feel like I don't fit into the crowd. So it's better sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of going in and actively pursue things. B What do you do to relax? A Probably listen to music and spend time with my dogs. B What are some things that make you really mad? A Probably people being ins. Not very, very nice to me or seeing. Seeing injustices or. I think that's about it. B How are you at controlling your temper? A Pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone? Probably a couple of days ago. One of my friends was saying that they were making a comment about how I am and I got kind of upset about that. Yeah, it does. B How close are you to them? A Pretty close. My best friend. So I just. One of my friends. B What do you do when you're annoyed? A I kind of am quiet about it. And when a person pushes me to a certain point, that's when I overreact. You usually. B How hard is that? A It's pretty hard. I rather the person notice that I'm kind of getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where it's like. It comes to a point where it blows out of proportion. Um, probably spending time with my family. In New York. B How close are you to your family? A Very close. B That's good. Who's some of it's been a positive influence in your life? A Um, my sister and my brother. B Tell me more about that. A Um, I don't know. They're just great people, and I love them a lot and they're a lot like me, so I feel like I have people that understand me. B That's good. How would your best friend describe you? A Um, probably, I guess, loyal, sensitive. I don't know. It's kind of hard. It's a hard question. B Okay. Have you ever served in the military? A No. B Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? A No. B Have you been diagnosed with depression? A Yes. B How long ago were you diagnosed? A Gosh, I think probably 1997. So a long time ago. B What got you to seek help. A During that time? I was just going through a lot of issues and I was feeling unsafe to myself, so I ended up going to the doctor to kind of get meds and have therapy and stuff. Not currently. Ended about, like, six months ago. B Why did you stop? A I just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me. I felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over, and she wasn't really challenging me. And I've been in therapy for a really long time, so I just knew it was a change. It's okay. B Do you feel like therapy is useful? A Yes, I do, actually. When I feel connected to a therapist, I feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what I'm going through. So, yes, I do. B What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going? A I'm better at describing my emotions and feelings. I think the biggest thing is when I'm in situations, I can see myself reacting one way and I take a step back and see how I can react normally almost in a way. Also, I tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel, like, really bad about myself. So it's nice to talk to someone that's not judging. That doesn't really tell me, like, you know, they tell me it's okay. Basically feeling hopeless all the time, not having, you know, enough energy to do things. I used to, like, had a little bit of concentration issues. Having weird, disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kind of crummy about life. Sometimes they are like, random moments. If there's, like, a problem with, like, my interpersonal life or something like that, or if I sometimes even seeing something on television, sometimes that affects Me. B How do you cope with that? A Listening to music or trying to distract myself? Trying, like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal, to record things. B How have you been feeling lately? A It's been a tough transition to come here. So, well, being here. So kind of half and half okay and not okay. B Have you noticed any changes in your behavior? A I feel like I've been a little bit more withdrawn lately, but that's about it. B Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? A Some days it's great, some days it's not. More recently it's been a little bit more difficult. I don't know why. I have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night, so I tend not to sleep very well. And I wake up quite frequently during the night, very groggy in the morning and that's about it. Like during the day I tend to yawn a lot. And my friends always are like, why are you yawning so much? Are you disinterested in what we're doing? And I'm trying to tell them it's not that at all. B Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? A Probably Christmas time when I was with my family. Just really happy and feeling like everything was alright in my life. Having a good sense of like where I was at that moment, being present with myself. B That's good. What would you say are some of your best comedies? A Probably, you know, let's see. It's a hard question. I think probably I can tend to read people kind of well sometimes. And I like to say I'm good at being a good friend to people, being a good family member. I'm a hard worker when I do have a job. So. Sure. I mean, it's life. So of course there's regrets. One that comes to mind is I wish that I don't eat as much so I can be a lot more healthy. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A Don't take things so seriously. Enjoy being youthful. And I think that's it. B Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? A I don't know. That's a good question. Probably my previous job and my employment. I worked really well with kids, so I did a great job at that. I was a researcher at a hospital and I helped a lot of kids out for about six years, so seven years. B Wow, that sounds interesting. A Yeah, it was awesome. B How did you decide to do that? A I was really inclined of like reading people and so I decided to major in psychology, so. And then I went and worked in a mental health facility and did research with them with drugs and depression and things like that. So it found, like, a good niche for me. B That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. A Okay. B Thanks for sharing your thoughts. A No problem.

"A thank you. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started and do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely unconventional. Do you agree with that? A yes. B ok. So how are you today? A good. B is good. Where do you come from? R I was born in Los Angeles, California. B really? What are the things you really like? A well, time and the fact that people are not as pervasive as on the east coast. B What are the things you don't really like at it? A fair traffic and smoggy time. B do you travel a lot? I used to. I'm unemployed now, so I rarely go anywhere. B ok. What do you study at school? A I have a BS in business with a computer option. B How did you decided to do this? R I thought that the only place where I could find a job with a business diploma was in accounting or in commercial computer methods, so I took this. I took the option of commercial computer methods. B ok. What is your dream work? Oh, I would probably be like a professional sports player or an actor. Something you like to do. B What things like to do for fun? A like cycling. I like to watch sporting events. Now, I can't afford to go to them, so I look more at television. I like to travel, but as I said, I have no more money for that. It's good. B What are the things that are really going crazy? A chicken people, they make their nose in the affairs of others, even if they are only foreigners. You expect this to be a family member or a friend, but you know, especially with the Internet, that feeds a lot. Now we know what Orwell was referring to when he talked about Big Brother in 1984. B What do you do when you are annoyed? R I am not very different from what I would do otherwise. B How are you going to control your temperament? R I had many explosions of temperament. B is good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it? R I argued with my aunt and it is because she made essentially leading statements, trying to trap me by saying something on a parent and that it bothers me a lot. B How far are you from your family? A I am in a way on the outings with my parents. B Why? A kind of black sheep. B I understand. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? A well, I mean, my mother did the most to help me. She did a lot, you know, more than anyone, by far. B tell me more about it. A well, I mean, it is right. I remember once when I was 13, I went with a friend to me to see the concert of Crosley, Stills, Nash and Young at the Forum. And she has seven children and she came to pick me up at the Sizzlers right in front of the. At 11 a.m. And I couldn't imagine with everything she had to do that day that she agreed to do it, but she did it. B What is one of your most memorable experiences? An OH, probably descending to the cape at the end of the Baja peninsula in Cabo San Lucas for having photographed the falls of the Nuptial Voile with Yosemite. B How did you feel at that time? A was probably the two most majestic sites I have ever seen. B It looks like an excellent situation. R It was when I could afford to travel. B Have you ever served in the army? A number B Have you ever received a diagnosis of PTS? A number B Have you received a diagnosis of depression? R I received a diagnosis of depression after a visit to the hospital in April 2011, and I took Lexapro. But I stopped after a day. I didn't want to do it anymore. B you are still going to therapy now? At number B why did you stop? R because I didn't think it was useful. I think it became a zombie. B It sucks. One yeah. B How have you been feeling lately? R I am depressed not to have a job for more than two years. I lost my job in October 2010, and with the exception of jobs like this, that I am lucky to get daily things, discussion groups like that, I did not work. B I'm sorry to hear that. A thank you. B It can be difficult to find one. A good job these days, especially when you are 56 years old. B Have you noticed these changes in your behavior or your thoughts lately? A well, just, I suppose the general feeling of despair. B How do you face it? A I go out a lot on my bike. I walk or bike four hours a day. About two hours each? Yeah. Very easy. Because now I'm old. When I was younger, I couldn't sleep more than four, six hours a night. B Why? R because I am agitated. Are B triggered by something? One no, but now that I'm old, I sleep much more easily. I pray before falling asleep, and that's where I can't have trouble sleeping. I just pray, recite different prayers, such as the Lord's prayer, Hail Marie, things like that. And I can fall from sleep. B when will you go back the last time you felt really happy? R I don't know. Probably. I cannot have specific memories of this. You k Now it was when I had money to spend. I know that. And when I had to have a job to have money to spend. So it was probably 15 years ago. B tell me about something that you recently did that you really enjoyed. A well, I really enjoyed anything. Last week, I won $ 75 for a job in the county. Basically, it was an emergency preparation exercise they were running for their staff and they enlisted people to play, mainly parents of people who had been in an autumn bombardment at the Staples Center. And we asked questions, registered, told, gave them information about our missing loved ones. And fundamentally, it was provided by the county and was mainly passed through a routine in downtown Los Angeles. B How difficult is it? A hard. It was just a routine that we had to follow. We had to act as if we actually handle someone and we had to give the details of their characteristics. Size, weight, etc. B WOW. How would your best friend describe you? R I don't have a best friend. B would you say that some of your best qualities are? A I am very brilliant. I am a perfectionist at my work. I would say that it is about this. I obtained a trade diploma and I was never a motivated person. I went to school, I went to two state colleges and two junior colleges to meet this end. So I think it was probably the most important contribution that I made to my, you know, to my self -esteem, you could say. So I had something to hang on the wall. B it's great. Is there anything you regret? A yeah, I regret, you know, alienating family members. B What advice would you give yourself? 10 or 20 years ago, I would not have been so impetuous and I left jobs thinking that I could always get another and not explode jobs. I could probably work with one of the employers I worked for. Now they have added locations, but I burned bridges there, so it's not possible. B ok. I think I asked for everything I need.

My mother was a teacher. My father was an absence officer. And I appreciated it. You keep you young. What is your dream work? B My dream work. My dream work would be to be a judge. Yes, in the youth court. It would be fantastic. But I should have thought about it earlier than now. So I'm not going to be able to do this. Do you consider yourself an introvert? B No, not at all. I like people who are a Round people. I am sometimes very talkative. I like to do a lot of things, and I am very social when I do them. A good. What do you do to relax? B Believe it or not, I play the bridge, I play chess and watch a good old film. A great. What are the things that make you really crazy? B Bad drivers, bad laws, politics. Often. What do you do when you are bored and I am bored? You know, I'm really not bored as much. I just dropped it. This is not worth the pain and the problems he could cause. If I can't straighten a problem, let it go. Go elsewhere. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone, and what was it? B Ooh, still my bridge partner. But it's different. Regarding something else, I don't really have people. I do not discuss. I don't like confrontation. R I see what you mean. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B My parents, of course. Very, a lot. I had grandparents. Can you tell me? B oh, my parents met in Tuskegee, which is a black college. They always wanted me to go to a black college, but of course, I didn't want to do that. I went to Illinois. These are a very positive model for me. There are certain things that I am not doing today. Because of them, I don't drink. I don't cursed. I don't look down, the people who do it. But I don't have as much respect for people who do a lot of these things. I loved driving. I loved traveling. And my father always took us somewhere. Each weekend, he left, we would go somewhere because we were in Chicago, Indiana, Michigan, somewhere in the region. We would go to Michigan, picked fruit, or we have all our dogs on puppy farms in Indiana, that kind of thing. I had an uncle who lived in the Wisconsin who was dairy producer. So my father liked to drive, and I loved driving too. A it's so good to hear. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B it's difficult. I had a lot of experiences. I think the best was that we were going to my birthday. We went to Europe. We went to Paris and we went up to the East Express. We. We did not go to Istanbul. We went from London to Venice, then returned to Paris. It was probably the best experience I ever had. In my life, I have never really taken care of Europe because there are so many things here in the United States to do and so much in America. And I went to Alaska and Hawaii, but we said we would do something different and we had always wanted to do everything on the East Express, And we did it. Dear, but a phenomenal trip. I have to do it once. It's a trip once. Not once in a life. Only once. A great. B is there something you regret not having traveled anymore? We did a lot when the children were younger, but there are a lot of things that we should probably have done, we did not do. I would like to have gone to Chicago. We are still going to Chicago in Thanksgiving. But I think we should have gone more than simply thanks to Thanksgiving. When my parents come here to Christmas. But I think we should have done much more about this. R could you have done something to avoid it? B yes. This is why it is a regret, because it could have been avoided. There are things we could have done and we spend our time working and more anxious to get ahead than to familiarize what is closest to us. I think people always exchange certain lines. Oh, yes, most certainly. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B oh, that's a good question. 10 or 20 years ago, I would have said, don't take things too seriously, but don't be too relaxed about them either. Sometimes you can take things for granted. Never take anything for granted. Nothing is promised. Have you ever served in the army? B oh, the paradise prohibited. No, I don't have it. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no, no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. How easy is it for you to have a good night's sleep? B very, very easy. I really have no problem with that. From time to time, if I am worried about something or that things to come or to due projects, then I become a little anxious. I don't like to be late. I don't like to make mistakes. So, I therefore have anxiety problems that will make me stand all night to get things right just to make sure I have everything good. How are you when you don't sleep well? B tired. I do not become irritable or anything. I'm just lethargic, maybe a little. Alright. I was standing late last night, so I'm a little tired now. But me. I generally have no problem sleeping and I have a good night's sleep. A it's good. Have you noticed changes in your behavior? Permanently. B no I don't have it. No not at all. I have just returned from a Christmas break. I should be very relaxed now. A it's so good to hear. What are you most proud of in your life? B oh, I have excellent children. I have a son at Young USC and I have a son at the UCLA and my daughter has just married. So I'm really proud of my children. They go to H Have a good life. R Do you find easy to be a parent? B oh, yes, I enjoyed it. I always appreciate that. Being a parent is forever. So what is the best thing to be a parent? Take care of someone else and make it start to have a good life. I think it's rewarding. Make sure everything is covered that must be covered with your children. Whether they are eating, they were sleeping, their clothes, they dress. Make sure they are satisfied. Make sure they have no problem at school or at home or they are physically, mentally, spiritually. All. Who makes sense. How would your best friend describe you? B My best friend will say that she has not changed since high school. Level to the head, but a great sense of humor, relaxed. I don't take things too seriously. A it's great. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? B oh, I like the holidays. I love Christmas. I love everything. I love preparing the house. I love cooking and cooking, freshly cooked. I love to experience new recipes. And so the last two weeks, because the holiday season was right there, I felt fantastic. Everything is calm. I am not at work, I am not at all stressed. I have no projects to do which I must think about. Anyway, then Christmas, vacation. A it's great. Tell me about something you have done recently that you really enjoyed. B really appreciated. Well, Christmas, of course. We went to Las Vegas on December 27. It was fantastic. We only stayed two days. We had a great time. We saw a big show, we had good food. We led there. We generally do not drive. I don't like driving a lot, but we led there and we just took our time. R so which seems to be an excellent situation. B It was good. It was nice. A good. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay, goodbye. B Goodbye. Thank you for listening. How is that? All right. I have to ring the bell. My mind wanders. Here we go. Hi. A so that you can go ahead and remove this helmet and I will stop the recording. B ok. One actually, before.

"A Okay, so now I'm going to put the door girl back over here. B All right? A When you're done, just press this button. B Okay, thank you. Thank you. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm okay. Feeling a little tired and worried. A Why? B Well, I'm looking for a place to live and I don't have a job right now, so things are a little shaky for me. A I'm sorry to hear that. It can be tough to find a good job these days. Where do you live? Where do you live? B I'm staying with my son in Venice. A How do you like your living situation? B It's pretty good, but both of us need to have our own space, so that's why I'm looking for another place to live. A I understand. Where are you from originally? B Originally from New York, but I've been in California since the early 70s. A That's a long time. B Yeah. A Why did you move to la? B I moved to LA because I had been living in Portland, Oregon, and I was getting tired of the weather up there and my son was down here, so it seemed like a good place to be. A How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B It wasn't too hard. I met people right away and I just really like it here, so it was easy to connect with people. A That's good. What are some things you really like about la? B The weather is number one for most people. I love being near the ocean. I like the energy, I like the artistic culture. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B Well, everybody loves the traffic. I mean, loves the weather and hates the traffic. So I kind of feel. I feel the same way. Sometimes it gets a little. Wearing that it's so busy and the fact that it's so expensive makes it difficult. A I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B No, not as much as I'd like. If I had more income, more funds, I would travel more. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B Well, mostly I've been. I traveled. Let's see. So my longest trip that was out of the country was to Mexico. And I traveled, drove down with a friend down to Oaxaca, and the whole trip we took about. I think took us about four weeks going down and back from the Bay Area. That was a fun trip. A How did you decide to do that? B Well, we've been working together on the census, and she had made that trip a few times and invited me to come along with her. A What's one of your most memorable experiences. B From that trip? I would say we were in Oaxaca for Day of the Dead. So it was celebrating Day of the Dead with the family in the little village that we were staying in. Everybody in the village makes an altar in their house for their loved ones who have passed away. And they also decorate. Clean and decorate the graves. So there were lots of flowers. And it was just. It was neat to be there and be with that family celebrating that. A Awesome. What did you study at school? B Well, I was in the liberal arts program, but I only stayed in school, in college for a couple of years, but I was most interested in liberal arts and the humanities. A What's your dream job? B My dream job would be personal. Assisting somebody who was in a creative field and getting to travel and go to events with them. A How hard is that? B It's hard to break into. I'm starting now very minimally, with somebody who I'm doing more of a volunteer work with, and I'm working on building up some of my skills so that I can be doing more of that. A That's good. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I'm fairly. I'm kind of a friendly introvert, so, you know, I have no trouble meeting people. I don't hold back and, you know, just. I'm not, like, shy at parties. I'll go up and talk to people, but I am overall kind of introverted, so I prefer one on one than big groups. A Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I like to watch. Well, I like to watch improvement shows like on hgtv. I like to watch, like, remodel shows and see transformations or watch movies or read. And I play some solitaire on my Kindle fire. A Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? B I don't usually realize I'm mad until later, so it doesn't really come up. And I just tend not to have the kind of life where those situations arise. Sometimes. You know, sometimes on the road, I get a little annoyed I don't get annoyed so much, like when people cut me off or anything like that, but when people are deliberately rude and honk for no reason, or when they get angry because maybe I've done something inadvertent, cut them off by mistake, and they get really angry, then that makes me angry in return. A When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? B Hmm. Yeah. Like I said, I don't really get into arguments. I was with a friend the other day, and she got annoyed with me because she felt like I was correcting her, so it wasn't really an argument. But she. You know, I had said something that she heard as a correction. Well, it was a correction, and she got angry. A How did you feel in that moment? B Well, then I felt criticized, and I felt. I felt vulnerable. I wasn't. It was. It was pretty uncomfortable. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. B Um, well, I. In that situation, I didn't have to correct her. So I think that's something I'm starting to look at in myself, is my need to be right. So, in general, I'm trying to catch that and just let people make mistakes without my telling them about it. A Mm. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Hmm. Hmm. Boy, I don't know. Gee, that's tough. I can't know that I've had that much trouble making decisions. Well, it was hard for me to decide to put my cat to sleep when he was sick, and I had to give up a cat, and I was moving once, and that was difficult, too. A I'm sorry to hear that. How did you decide to do that? B Well, in the case of the first cat, the one who was sick, I decided when the vet said that he thought it was the humane decision. And with the cat, I had to give up. I didn't really decide. I was moving to a place where I couldn't take her, and so I found somebody who could take her. A Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B See, that's tough. So I don't really. The erasing from the memory part. There's nothing I really wish I could erase from my memory. Trying to think of something that I've done that I wish I hadn't done. Oh, okay. I remember something. There was a time when I was. I was in a class at junior college. It was a film class, and I was the one who was. After we went out and did a little film project and were supposed to bring it back into class the next week. I was the one who had the film and through different, just things that were happening in my life right now. I never went back to the school, but I never brought them the film back. So all the work they had done they had to do over again. And I still feel bad about that. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B It's pretty easy. Sometimes I wake up in the early morning hours and and have trouble going back to sleep, but that's not very often. A How have you been feeling lately? B I've been feeling kind of tired and low level depressed, like not feeling a lot of options. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yes, I have. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B Well, there were two times. There was once back in like 1972. About 1972 or three, and then another time. Oh, so then when would that have been? About 16 years ago. A What got you to seek help? B Just feeling like there wasn't, you know, feeling that things weren't going to change if I didn't get some help and that if I didn't have to, you know, that maybe if I got some medication that would help me in the short term. A Do you still go to therapy now? B I'm not going to therapy right now. A Why did you stop? B I was moving around a lot. Finances. I wasn't really feeling the need. Starting to think it might be an option again. A Do you feel like therapy is useful? B I feel like therapy can be useful, yes. A What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? B Well, when I went to therapy, it was helpful to have somebody who listened and could also offer impartial suggestions for helping me to improve the way I was feeling. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Well, I was on the beach last weekend. It was a beautiful day and I was sitting in the sun and just relaxing. I had my notebook and I was doing some writing and I felt very happy and content. A That sounds like a great situation. What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm kind and compassionate and I'm a good listener and I'm intelligent and I have good ideas. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Well, I wish that sometimes I wish I was a harder worker. I'm not really willing to take low wage jobs even though I need work. So I just don't feel like I'm willing to do anything. And I wish I could act. I said I had good ideas I have good ideas and I'm good at the onset, but I'm not really good on the follow through. So a lot of those ideas get started, but then I don't take them the distance. That's probably the thing I'd like to change about myself the most. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B 10 or 20 years ago I'd give myself the advice to go back to school and get my degree, finish my education and be willing to work a regular job and to start putting money away for my retirement. A What are you most proud of in your life? B Proud of my children and I'm proud of the friendships I have. And I'm proud that people. People do admire me and value my opinion. A That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. B Goodbye. Okay. Okay.

"A You. B Okay? All right, I think I got it. A This has to. Yeah. Be away from your mouth so that it works. B Okay. Like that? A Yeah, for some reason, otherwise it doesn't work. B Okay, so this is Ellie. Okay, I guess. A Oh no, I guess I'm gonna start the recording. Okay, so, yeah, she's just gonna ask you a series of questions and then when she's done, she should say goodbye. But if for any reason she stops for more than 10 to 15 seconds, something may have gone wrong and you can press the button if not, when she says goodbye. And right now she can't answer any questions. She can only ask questions. Just so you know. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Fine. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B San Francisco. A Alright, what are some things you really like about la? B The beaches, fire pits, the ocean, movies, entertainment, business. The different areas, the weather. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B It's really difficult to get around by bus. It's terrible not having a car. That's the hardest part. You can't really do LA without a car in every way. Do you travel a lot by bus? I do. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B My most memorable experiences. A What did you study at school? B Oh, what did I study at school? I studied. Studied. I'm studying acting right now, is what I'm doing. A What do you do now? B I'm studying acting and I'm working a day job that doesn't pay enough money. So I'm trying to find additional day jobs or I don't know how to. I'm trying to figure out how to live with joy. That's how to live with joy. That's when your life flows, is when you do more of what brings you joy. That's my current dilemma. A What's your dream job? B I think my dream job would be weighing 70 pounds less and being a really emotionally diverse actress so I could play comedy roles, which is easier for me, and heavy drama roles, which is more of a challenge to be vulnerable and to open up emotionally. So that's kind of what I'm studying right now. And I would look at the thousand percent better because my Hair would be long. I really am thinking I don't have a family anymore. My father passed away, and there's no relationship with my sister and a very poor one with my mother. So it's almost like not having any family anymore. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B Take a shower. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Pretty good. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B I guess it was a couple months ago, and it was a friend that kind of flipped out on me. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B That would be the situation I wish I did handle it differently. A What's something you feel guilty about? B Infidelity. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B That's a good question. The hardest decision I've ever had to make. Well, I had an amazing cat. And if you can imagine, it was more than a cat. It was like a being, a very large entity in the body of a cat. And my cat passed away, and I had to. I wanted to have a proper burial at an animal cemetery and have a memorial service for my cat. And my mother was against these ideas. That was too much for a cat. And so it took me two and a half months to come up with the money to find his casket and to decide on what style of casket I wanted. Because it was so hard to own that decision when I didn't get any support over it. But eventually I triumphed. And I found an artisan in Tennessee that makes cedar chests. And he made me the most beautiful cedar casket. Octagonal. Octagonal with ivory lining and plush padding on the inside of the casket. And the people at the animal cemetery said that in 20 years of business, they'd never seen such a beautiful casket. And they'd never seen someone that gave so much to their animal. So I felt really, really good when I saw the way that I was sort of like sending my cat, you know, into the cemetery. A Tell me about Nevette or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Oh, an event I could erase from my memory. I think I have erased a lot of events from my memory. Well, I've probably had a lot of them. Weird experiences. Definitely. Have you ever served in the military? No. A All right. How have you been feeling lately? B Well, you know, I'm a very determined human being. So I work myself into being in positive states of mind. But overall I think that I'm definitely realizing I have some deep depression and essentially I just need more of a support network here in la. I need to create a new family and that's basically what I need to really do. Which is difficult because it's hard to have a family and family and friends, people that you can really, really trust. And it's just hard to get around LA without a car. So I feel a lack of support in my life and I feel isolated and lonely. Other than that, I'm very optimistic. Any changes in my behavior? Yeah, I walk to work, which is in Beverly Hills and I walk through Beverly Hills and I noticed that even though I'm walking around nice places, I'm joyless when I'm walking to work. It doesn't really make me that happy. It makes me happier when I get to the commercial part and there's more people around and there's lots of kind of like activity and shops. It does nothing for me like walking through the neighborhoods. I noticed, I noticed that I have a lot of lethargy in my body, which is depression. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B I'm really working hard at going to sleep before midnight and I notice that it makes a big difference when I do get enough sleep. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B I'm fine, I'm just tired, but I think I'm, you know, pretty fine. Energy wise in terms of interacting with other people. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Ptsd? No. A Diagnosed with depression? B Yes. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B Recently. A What were your symptoms? B Lethargy, lack of joy, lack of community, lack of close bonds, lack of support network, no one to talk to, not a lot of energy to do extra things that would help make your life better. It's just sort of get into the struggle of just getting through the day and then trying to find the energy to do something to make it better. Yeah, I think I know what my overall trigger, what the overall thing is, but it's deeper than the overall thing itself, if that makes any sense. Well, I. You guys are gonna think I'm a complete whack job, but honestly, I'm really not. I. I called my mother yesterday and I left her a message and at the end of the message I said I love you. And that's a month since she called me, which was my birthday. When she called me, I didn't answer, but she didn't say she loved me. The year before that she didn't even call me on my birthday and she said she wasn't feeling well. And we had a falling out in November. So I haven't spoken to her since the falling out. But essentially what I realized in November was just a tremendous amount of inability to love that she has towards me. And I think it's a lifelong thing. So I think it's hard for me to get close to people and to bond with people because if you can't trust your mother, who can you trust? And if you haven't received love from your mother and you don't know really how to receive love, actually something about receiving love or receiving self worth or validation or something like that. I think that lack of support throughout my whole life, regardless of how ambitious or determined I am, there's an underpinning really every day of sadness about that, not having a mother. And so that's I think, the main challenge to work out in my psyche or soul or emotions, something like that. A How do you cope with them? B How do I cope with my emotions? Well, I sit with them alone mainly since there's no one to share the deeper ones with that would really understand me. There's no long term relationships, but I do interact with my emotions a lot when I'm training my instrument in acting class. And so that's a big workout emotionally. A What got you to seek help? B A couple months ago I went through a patch where I didn't have a place to stay and ended up staying with someone that I thought was a student friend. She turned out to be crazy and I had to leave there and as a result I had to seek counseling per the mandate of my school. That's the incident that triggered it. A Do you still go to therapy now? B Yes. A Okay. Do you feel therapy is expected? B Therapy is useful. It's a reflective experience. So you're reflective throughout the week before you see your therapist. And then you sort of start thinking on a deeper level about a theme, a current theme that's like what's really the issue? And then it feels very look forward to having someone to talk to that can really listen. So the gift of active listening and then feeling a satisfaction from another human being caring about you, your welfare and having someone to talk to. On a deeper level. A When was the last time you felt really happy? B When I was in my acting class. Which was. Well, I took some classes, I audited some classes last week and at those moments, a lot of joy. And when I was at my school studying, which was like two and a half months ago. A That'S great. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Who's been a positive influence in my life that would be the most positive influence was my cat, Benjamin and my former partner. No best friends at the moment. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B I went to UCB and saw Improv. A Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? B I'm most proud of my care for my cat and I'm most proud of my relationship with my cat. And I'm most proud of that. I have been making a lot of progress, you know, working on career stuff, and I have a positive attitude, even though it's very difficult growing up with a family that doesn't give you the kind of emotional or financial support. So I've grown up with a lot of jealousy and negativity and lack of support. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B You're welcome. Goodbye. A To a different room. Back to the waterfall room. Actually, I'll take you there in a second.

"A So just give her a little bit and then she'll start up on her own. And then again just press this button when you're ready. B Thank you. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. B Hello. A To talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free you to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yeah. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm alright. A little tired. A Okay. Where are you from originally? B I live in Culver City. Originally I. I was. I grew up in Venice. A What are some things you really like about la? B The beach, fast drivers. The city. I've lived in Utah. I don't really like anything else but the city. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B I don't know many people who live here anymore. Traffic, it's too big. But it's home. A I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B I've been out of the country a few times. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Seeing new places. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B When I was 14, I went to Costa Rica to visit my father and I was there for two weeks and that was the last time I've been there. A Nice. B What's one of your most memorable experiences in Costa Rica? Seeing my father for the first time in a few years was definitely a shocker. A How did you feel in that moment? B Um, joy. I was happy, excited, kind of scared. A What made you decide to do that? B It wasn't my decision, it was my mom's. She'd planned the trip. A Are you happy you did that? B Yeah. A That's good. What did you study at school? B I wanted to be an art major, but I didn't understand why. I was in math classes among other classes and I thought I was wasting my time so I decided I really didn't want to do that so I moved back to la. A Okay. What's your dream job? B I don't really have a dream job. I would like to be self employed though. A Can you tell me about that? B Right now I'm thinking about going to school to become a personal trainer, but I'm not really sure. A Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing. B Around new people? I'm very reserved with the people I do know. I'm A lot more outgoing and talkative. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B Umm. To relax, I go on walks. I walk my dog a lot. I call my girlfriend if I want to calm down. I also do meditation and self hypnosis. I try. A How hard is that? B It depends on how I'm feeling or how upset I am or how calm I'm trying to be. A Can you tell me about that? B If I'm really upset, it's a lot harder for me to calm down and bring myself down through meditation or through self hypnosis. But yeah. A How are you at controlling your temper? B I'm alright at it. Sometimes I lose it. I yell when I lose my temper and I have put holes in walls. A Has that gotten you in trouble? B Not yet. A When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? B Last night? Me and my mom got in an argument. It was about me buying a ticket last night for a Greyhound to go to Utah. A What made you decide to do that? B I'm going up there to work for a few weeks and make a little bit of money and I need to buy my ticket a week in advance and I didn't want to do it last night. A Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. B That situation last night. I wish I had not blown up or gotten as raged enraged as I can over the situation because it escalated. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B My little sister I'm very close with. She's 15 years old. She's about to turn 16 in a few days. I would do anything for her. She is the world to me, my mom. We fight, we push each other's buttons. I believe she views me as my father. She believes that I will not succeed at anything. A How did you feel in that moment? B Sad. A I'm sorry. B It's okay. A Tell me about Nevette or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Um. I wish I could forget most of my high school years or my sophomore year. A Why? B I just didn't like high school or my sophomore year. I. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Getting sober and going to a drug rehab. A Can you tell me about that? B When I was 16, I got. I started doing a few different drugs and it got out of hand, I guess. And my mom was trying to get me help and I didn't want the help. So I kept escaping to different places and running away and not wanting to be in the places. I finally agreed to go to Utah and try and get sober. A Influence in your life. Tell me more about that. B He's been my best friend my entire life. Ever since I can remember. And we grew up together. He used to use drugs with me and he's been sober for more than a year now. A That's great. How. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Almost impossible. A Why? B I either have to have no sleep the night before to get a few hours or I just don't sleep well. And I'm against taking pills. And I stopped smoking marijuana and so now I just. I don't sleep or haven't been but past few weeks. A That sounds really hard. B Yeah, it's not fun. A How do you cope with them? B I lay in bed until I finally fall asleep in the early morning. Or I watch TV until late at night. Or Netflix. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B I'm out of it. I'm tired, I'm groggy. I'm a lot more likely to. My anger is a lot more likely to come out. A I understand. How have you been feeling lately? B I've been alright. This weekend has been better than most. My girlfriend has stayed at my place the entire weekend. So I've been happy. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts like me? B I don't. I'm not as irritable. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. But yes. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B I was probably. I was. I believe I was 12 the first time I was diagnosed. I've been diagnosed multiple times though. Most recent time being less than a year ago. A What got you to seek help? B My mom sought help for me. She saw that I was unhappy and she became worried. A Do you still go to therapy now? B No. A Why? Did you see? B I stopped on June 1st when I graduated my drug rehab program in Utah of last year. A What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? B I learned coping skills so I'm able to calm myself down when I'm angry easier. I know how to stay away from me, my trigger points. And getting away from staying away from being angry or becoming depressed. It can be if the person's willing to change and wanting it. A I see what you mean. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B 2 days ago. A Can you tell me about that? B It was because I was with my girlfriend. We were having a moment and so I Was just overwhelmed by the happiness, I guess. A That's so good to hear. How would your best friend describe you? B Trustworthy? Funny shit? I don't. Outgoing, smart, Athletic. He would. Yeah. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B I wish I wasn't. I was so short fused. I wish I wasn't depressed. I wish I didn't feel like I needed something to help me sleep. I wish I was just completely dependable on myself. A Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. B Um. When I was younger, my father would. He once hit my dog in front of me because he was mad at me. So he started hitting the dog and. I don't know, that was probably the biggest thing since I was little. I remember just being sad. A I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything you regret? B Yeah, everyone has something they regret. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Not to be so naive. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B I went to hypnosis. I had an appointment for hypnosis a few days ago. A Tell me more about that. B It was really relaxing, really calming, and I feel like it could help me. A What made you decide to do that? B One of my mom's colleagues referred her to a psychiatrist who's really good with ADHD and patients like that. A Cool. What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm athletic. I'm nice. I like to. I put other people before myself most of the time. I don't know if that's a negative quality or positive. I. I don't know. A Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B My ideal weekend, I would either go to a few parties or I'll hang out with my girlfriend out in Fullerton or I'll be in Los Angeles or the beach. A What are you most proud of in your life? B I haven't really felt like I've accomplished anything to be adequately proud of. But I did very well in sports in high school, and that's really it. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. B Okay. A Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.

"A Done like this. All right. Sorry, one second. Okay, so she's going to ask you questions again and then when she says goodbye, just press this and I'll come back in. B Okay? A Hi, I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally 5ish. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Good, thanks. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B The East Coast. When did you move to LA for work. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B Rarely. I prefer it out here. A How does it compare to la? B It's not as nice as the lifestyle out here. I like the weather better and just a lot of things about living here. It's my favorite city. A I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B Somewhat, but I mostly. What's that? Just. I like to go to France a lot. I like the food there and just the lifestyle, the shopping, that sort of thing. A Nice. What did you study at school? B Art history and marketing. Well, I became interested in high school and I thought it was a good classical education. And I interned at Andy Warhol's magazine when I was in high school and so that. Yes, yes, I'm pretty happy with what I'm doing. I do consulting, so I write marketing plans, that sort of thing. A How hard is that? B It can be fairly hard. A Can you tell me about that? B About writing a marketing plan? I don't know. It's hard to talk to someone about it who's not in marketing. It requires just a knowledge of how it's done and it takes several months to do one. A Do you consider yourself more shy or a villain? B Um. Well, I guess I'm. I originally kind of shy, but I become more outgoing just because of work and stuff. A That's good. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I like to exercise. I do hiking with my dogs. We walk up and down a hill a couple times. Good. I don't remember. I don't know. Nothing comes to mind. Sometimes I don't clean my car. I get lots of dog hair in it and I feel Bad when I should always stay on top of that. Just getting to the car wash and stuff. Well, I had a conflict with my brother, and so I had to decide to have an estrangement from him, and that makes the most sense. And that was a somewhat difficult decision. But just because of his angry behavior. It wasn't. It wasn't that difficult. But, you know, it was somewhat difficult because I loved him very much. So. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B I'm not close to my family, so I don't really have one. I have a Japanese friend. Uh. Oh, I think the sensor came off. I have a Japanese friend I'm very close with. She's like my. Kind of my mother, and I just met them socially. I don't know. Nothing comes to mind. Yeah, I think the sensor came off. Okay. Just kind of a. A Okay. B Okay. A Sorry about that. B Oh, sure. Okay. All right. A Sorry. B Okay. A Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Pretty easy, because I keep a regular schedule. I'm just kind of tired, maybe a little bit irritable. A How have you been feeling lately? B Good. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior? B Well, I'm recovering from ptsd, so I sometimes feel the ptsd, and then I'll take a medication for that. A Are you treated for something? B No, it's just leftover. I still have the stress from it. I'm still being treated for it. I don't really have any. I prefer not to talk about it in the past, but it's treated. Five years ago, I was just very sad, very depressed, and so I still had anxiety. So I went to see a doctor, and they helped me, and I did psychotherapy. A Do you still go to therapy now? B Yeah. For the ptsd, though? I don't know. I guess just kind of supportive because of the issues I have with my family. It's supportive to have a doctor who is supportive and, you know, it just gives me good feedback and helps me to make good decisions, that sort of thing. A Do you have disturbing thoughts? B Yeah, I have nightmares about my family sometimes. Yeah. Thanks. I just try to sleep better before I go to sleep. I sort of, like, meditate a little bit to be calm and then hope that that will help. A Really happy. B I feel happy all the time. Pretty much like my dogs make me happy and, you know, my life is really happy, so that's great. Mm. A How are your best friends? Right here. B I guess, you know, as a nice person, I'm thoughtful, a good friend, and happy, fun person. A What are some things in which you could change about yourself? B I don't know. I mean, I'm in my 40s now, so I'm pretty happy with myself. You know, my, you know, I've done a lot of. A lot of work on myself in therapy and stuff. So I'm pretty. I wouldn't really change a lot. I'm pretty happy with myself. I mean, not to sound conceited, but I'm pretty happy with myself now. That would be my parents. They're very abusive, so I don't talk to them anymore. So any times with them, they did terrible things to me. I prefer not to talk about it. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Let's see. Well, I just started reading a book. I like to read cookbooks and I was just reading a book called When French Women Cook. And it's about a woman's relationship with different women in France, in different parts of France and the cooking. And so I'm really enjoying that book. I usually, you know, get the grocery shopping done, which I enjoy. I really like doing the grocery shopping. I go to a few places and then do a bit of cleaning and just relax. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Oh, yeah, I would say to have better self esteem because I used to have very low self esteem, you know, from being abused. And so, you know, I wish I'd been happier in the past and you know, it's taken me a long time to become happy because, you know, no matter what I did, whatever achievements, I was never happy in the past. I was always struggling with being depressed. I didn't even know why. And now I realize because of whatever events that it was from my parents, from that relationship. And so the advice would be to not have a relationship that is bad for you. Like sometimes estrangement is the best choice in an abusive relationship. Just the way I live my life, the way I treat people, I think, you know, I believe your deeds are very important and I try to treat people in a good way. And I guess I'm proud of my work decisions I've made that give me a job that I like, that gives me a lot of flexibility and I do what I like. And people like my work and also my dogs. I'm really proud of them. Yeah, I got. I don't know. Okay, thank you. Bye. That was funny. Yeah. And then just do the surface.",0,done like right sorri one second okay go ask question say goodby press come back b okay hi ali thank come today creat talk peopl safe secur environ therapist learn peopl would love learn ask question get us start pleas feel free tell anyth answer total 5ish okay b ye okay today b good thank good origin b east coast move la work often go back hometown b rare prefer compar la b nice lifestyl like weather better lot thing live favorit citi sure tell shoe much world explor travel lot b somewhat mostli like go franc lot like food lifestyl shop sort thing nice studi school b art histori market well becam interest high school thought good classic educ intern andi warhol magazin high school ye ye pretti happi consult write market plan sort thing hard b fairli hard tell b write market plan know hard talk someon market requir knowledg done take sever month one consid shi villain b um well guess origin kind shi becom outgo work stuff good sometim feel tens turn fish tank screensav hey know hawaii best got relax b like exercis hike dog walk hill coupl time good rememb know noth come mind sometim clean car get lot dog hair feel bad alway stay top get car wash stuff well conflict brother decid estrang make sens somewhat difficult decis angri behavior difficult know somewhat difficult love much tell relationship famili b close famili realli one japanes friend uh oh think sensor came japanes friend close like kind mother met social know noth come mind yeah think sensor came okay kind okay b okay sorri b oh sure okay right sorri b okay okay easi get good night sleep b pretti easi keep regular schedul kind tire mayb littl bit irrit feel late b good notic chang behavior b well recov ptsd sometim feel ptsd take medic treat someth b leftov still stress still treat realli prefer talk past treat five year ago sad depress still anxieti went see doctor help psychotherapi still go therapi b yeah ptsd though know guess kind support issu famili support doctor support know give good feedback help make good decis sort thing disturb thought b yeah nightmar famili sometim yeah thank tri sleep better go sleep sort like medit littl bit calm hope help realli happi b feel happi time pretti much like dog make happi know life realli happi great mm best friend right b guess know nice person thought good friend happi fun person thing could chang b know mean 40 pretti happi know know done lot lot work therapi stuff pretti would realli chang lot pretti happi mean sound conceit pretti happi would parent abus talk anymor time terribl thing prefer talk tell someth recent realli enjoy b let see well start read book like read cookbook read book call french women cook woman relationship differ women franc differ part franc cook realli enjoy book usual know get groceri shop done enjoy realli like groceri shop go place bit clean relax advic would give 10 20 year ago b oh yeah would say better self esteem use low self esteem know abus know wish happier past know taken long time becom happi know matter whatev achiev never happi past alway struggl depress even know realiz whatev event parent relationship advic would relationship bad like sometim estrang best choic abus relationship way live life way treat peopl think know believ deed import tri treat peopl good way guess proud work decis made give job like give lot flexibl like peopl like work also dog realli proud yeah got know okay thank bye funni yeah surfac

B Well, you know. C Okay, so now I'm gonna start her up. She's gonna chat with you for a bit, and then when she's done, she'll let you know and I will move. B The doorbell over here. Okay. All right, thank you. All right. What do I say? She'll ask you questions. Oh, okay. Hello, I'm Ellie. A Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Sure. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Good. Little tired. A Where are you from originally? B Indianapolis, Indiana. A Really? Why did you move to la? B I'm a singer. A Awesome. How did you decide to do that? B I like singing. A Okay. What are some things you really like about la? B Diversity. My girlfriend's from Taiwan, so. Dealing with different cultures. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B The traffic, the crazy people. It seems hard to get anything really accomplished. A I see what you mean. How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B It took me about six months just to figure out the directions. A When did you move to LA? B 28 years ago. A Wow, that's a long time. B A long time. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B I haven't been there in about eight or ten years. A Why? B Well, I don't like my brother, so I don't want to hang around him. A Okay. Do you travel a lot? B I started. My girlfriend we did about. Just went back, got back from Orlando and she likes to travel, so. A Nice. What do you enjoy about traveling? B Meeting new people, see new places. Helps me to get out of LA and get a different perspective. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B I just did the Avatar seminar, which is like, raise your consciousness and clean out the crap in your head. Are you happy you did that? Yeah, I feel better. I have a lot of psychic attack, and I'm psychic, so it's very hard to deal with it. A Tell me more about that. B Well, there's more to life than what you see. So a lot of things are in other dimensions in other places. So you have to deal with not only the emotions, but people direct energy at you. A How hard is that? B Well, to do a lot of clearing and grounding and stay true to yourself. A Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? B I'm both. Well, I'm introverted because I like to spend time by myself, and I'm extroverted because I like to meet new people. I used to be totally an introvert. Watch movies, watch tv, read, do crosswords. I'm a singer. Sing, write music. Writing a novel. It's sort of like the Matrix. A Awesome. How hard is that? B Well, I wrote the first 20 pages pretty quick, so now I'm expanding it. A Decide to do that. B I get inspiration. It was actually a dream, and then I wrote down the dream, and now it's becoming. I could probably turn it into a movie. Yeah, well, people don't respect me. That's the number one. A Do you feel that way often? B No, I just. That my brothers, they don't respect me. They don't really, you know, I want to love my family, but I don't want to hang around my brother. So it's a conflict. Exactly. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Pretty good. I only get mad about once a year. My girlfriend, about two or three months ago, she was wanting me to do something and I said no, and I don't know. Yeah. A Okay. How do you know them? B She's my girlfriend. I know her for about a year now. A How close are you to them? B Pretty close. A Okay, what's one of your most memorable experiences? B One time I was singing, and I was singing to an audience, and that was great. A Okay, what do you do now? B Well, I'm looking into ways to expand my consciousness so that I can have more money and more abundance in my life so I can have my own house and live in my own creative space. A What's your dream job? B Singing. I'm a singer, so I sing, like, unforgettable, so that's what I like to do. A That's great. Have you ever served in the military? B No. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Well, that's the hard part. I don't. A Why? B I don't know. Maybe it's because when I was a kid, my brothers beat me up and I don't feel totally rested in myself or my Life. So. So I feel like I don't feel totally safe. Yeah, a little irritable, but I have been sleeping better since I met my girlfriend, so it's not totally bad. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior? B No way. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior? Constantly. B Behavior what? I don't know. Well, I feel more positive. I did the seminar and so that let me get rid of some crap in my brain and be more positive about life. Well, I did a lot of exercises to reduce my stress and a lot of my stress comes from judging myself and other people. A Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? B Yeah, you could say that. Well, I don't know. It's hard. Hard to deal with sometimes. Sometimes a lot. Much too critical for my own good. A How do you cope with them? B Well, watching TV and stuff. But lately I just been feeling like I need to have less judgment and more fun. A That's good. What made you decide to do then? B I did that seminar. A Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? B About a week ago, I think. Well, I went to that seminar, I got there and I was able to take off work, be in a different environment because my job is stressful and what? My life is stressful. So I was able to take a break, which is great. Outgoing, fun, smart. But I'm in la. People in la, they don't want to. Most of them don't want to spend time with you. I don't know if that's because of me or la. A That makes sense. Is there anything you regret? B That I spend a lot of my time worrying and criticizing myself instead of moving forward. Avoid it. Yeah. I'm watching TV or going to see movies or trying not to think of it, but it doesn't solve the problem. Well, a little bit. I haven't paid my bills a lot. I still owe money, so it's kind of a self defeating prophecy. A What advice would you give yourself to knowing for 20 years? B Stop criticizing and start creating your future now instead of waiting for it to happen. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B My girlfriend's been really helpful. A Tell me more about that. B Well, she's funny and she loves me and cares about me and. Yeah. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B SINGER and I'm intelligent and creative and multidimensional and I'm a good listener. A What are you most proud of in your life? B I've written about four or five books. My voice I think would be number one because When I started, I didn't have much of a singing voice, but now I do. A That's good. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing. B Okay. Bye. Bye. Doorbell. Yeah. Okay. Can I take it off? Yeah.",0,okay great b okay sound let tri someth real quick c go launch virtual human sec get glimps b take back tri make guy work b yeah like matrix oh virtual c come back second gon na tri one b right c go work b well know c okay gon na start gon na chat bit done let know move b doorbel okay right thank right say ask question oh okay hello elli thank come today creat talk peopl safe secur environ therapist learn peopl would love learn ask question get us start pleas feel free tell anyth answer total confidenti okay b sure okay today b good littl tire origin b indianapoli indiana realli move la b singer awesom decid b like sing okay thing realli like la b divers girlfriend taiwan deal differ cultur thing realli like la b traffic crazi peopl seem hard get anyth realli accomplish see mean easi get use live la b took six month figur direct move la b 28 year ago wow long time b long time often go back hometown b eight ten year b well like brother want hang around okay travel lot b start girlfriend went back got back orlando like travel nice enjoy travel b meet new peopl see new place help get la get differ perspect love hear one trip b avatar seminar like rais conscious clean crap head happi yeah feel better lot psychic attack psychic hard deal tell b well life see lot thing dimens place deal emot peopl direct energi hard b well lot clear ground stay true okay consid introvert b well introvert like spend time extrovert like meet new peopl use total introvert watch movi watch tv read crossword singer sing write music write novel sort like matrix awesom hard b well wrote first 20 page pretti quick expand decid b get inspir actual dream wrote dream becom could probabl turn movi yeah well peopl respect number one feel way often b brother respect realli know want love famili want hang around brother conflict exactli control temper b pretti good get mad year girlfriend two three month ago want someth said know yeah okay know b girlfriend know year close b pretti close okay one memor experi b one time sing sing audienc great okay b well look way expand conscious money abund life hous live creativ space dream job b sing singer sing like unforgett like great ever serv militari b ever diagnos ptsd b diagnos depress b easi get good night sleep b well hard part b know mayb kid brother beat feel total rest life feel like feel total safe yeah littl irrit sleep better sinc met girlfriend total bad notic chang behavior b way notic chang behavior constantli b behavior know well feel posit seminar let get rid crap brain posit life well lot exercis reduc stress lot stress come judg peopl think mayb littl hard b yeah could say well know hard hard deal sometim sometim lot much critic good cope b well watch tv stuff late feel like need less judgment fun good made decid b seminar okay last time felt realli happi b week ago think well went seminar got abl take work differ environ job stress life stress abl take break great outgo fun smart la peopl la want want spend time know la make sens anyth regret b spend lot time worri critic instead move forward avoid yeah watch tv go see movi tri think solv problem well littl bit paid bill lot still owe money kind self defeat propheci advic would give know 20 year b stop critic start creat futur instead wait happen someon posit influenc life b girlfriend realli help tell b well funni love care yeah would say best qualiti b singer intellig creativ multidimension good listen proud life b written four five book voic think would number one start much sing voic good okay think ask everyth need thank share b okay bye bye doorbel yeah okay take yeah

B Not that. A Okay. What do you do when you're annoyed? B Take a walk. A How are you at controlling your temper? B I'm okay. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Three days ago? Just some dude cut me off while I was driving and I laid on my horn and he got pissed off and I got pissed off. A Oh, no. Has that gotten you in trouble? B Not really. People don't really do shit in la. They just sort of act mad, but they don't do anything here, so. A Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? B I don't know. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B I could have done more to prepare and work a lot harder for the last set of interviews I had in full. A Like what? B Just.

A Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B My grad school audition at Juilliard. A Can you tell me about that? B It was stressful. It's just like the top 10 people of the past 50 years in your field, and you're in a room for them, and they'll either love what you do or hate what you do. A That sounds really hard. B Yeah, it was pretty shitty. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Deciding to not marry my fiance and pursue my career instead. A What made you decide to do that?

B I just have a lot on my plate and a lot to do in order to get where I want to be and be who I want to be. So how do you cope with them working harder? Just plowing through it. A That's good. What are you like when you don't. B Sleep well, I mean. I never really sleep well, so I don't. I don't really know. A Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No, I don't. Not formally. Yeah. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B I was. About high school. Ish. A What got you to seek help? B Family, maybe. A Can you tell me about that? B Nothing to say, really.

I started learning how to surf. It was pretty chill. A Cool. What made you decide to do that? B Uh, just like Buddy was doing it. So I'll give it a shot. A How would your best friend describe you? B Ridiculous. A Uh huh. B Mm. A Is there anything you regret? B Just not being as far along as I wanted to be. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Don't think about going to law school. Get a head start on studying music and. Yeah. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B I'd like to put on a good five to ten pounds of muscle. I definitely want to be further along professionally. Uh, yeah. And sleep more. Be able to turn my mind off more. A Okay.

"A Important. I wonder if people really, like, understand it. You know what I mean? Like, if people do judge. Yeah, it's bizarre. B Everything looks good. I'm gonna do something that just. A I did, like, the Ricki Lake show with my friend and I saw myself on tv. Oh, my God. Yeah. But I was eating. I was. I was eating candy and I was going feel like that. And then I was looking at Ricki Lake, like, there must be something wrong in my eyes. Because I was like. She was like, right there. I don't know. Fuck. And so I had to actually, like, act. You know, I'm in the audience. But I had to, like, pretend like I was interested in what she had to say. But I looked. So I kept looking at her like that, like there was something wrong with my eyes. No, I just saw. I was in a doctor's office and they had it on and like. Oh, God. It was funny because there was these guys, like, winking at me on the way out. Like, that was celebrity. And I'm like, I couldn't pay Duodian sitting there. It's like I hated every minute of it. But we got sewing machines. Free sewing machines. $200 sewing machines. That day it was. Yeah. So it was worth it. It was worth it. But I was so embarrassed. Yeah. Only if you get stuff, it's worth it. Otherwise, they're so stupid. The shows are so. I can't believe that's why I don't watch television. It's so embarrassing. Okay, so I'm gonna start up chat. B With you for a bit. A Okay. B I'm gonna give you the doorbell again, so when she's done, she'll let you know. A Okay. Right on. Okay. This is so weird. Oh, gosh. I hope she's nice to me. I hope so. Okay. Hello. Oh, God. C Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Yes. C Okay. So how are you doing today? A Fine. Just tired. C I'm sorry to hear that. Where are you from originally? A California. C Really? A From Hollywood. C What are some things you really like about la? A Not too much. There's not too many things I like about it. C Okay. What are some things you don't really like about la? A The people. It's not clean. Too much crime. Too many drugs. C What do you study at school. A Makeup and hair. C That sounds interesting. A It is. C Are you still working? A A little bit. C What do you do now? A Not too much. I just survive. Very difficult. C What's your dream job? A I'm getting a little old to be thinking of a career, but. But I just want probably to get married and have a little security, that's all. Just be a wife again. C Okay. How close are you to your family? A A little bit close, but everybody's pretty much passed away. I play Farmville on Facebook. C That's great. A Yeah. C How are you at controlling your temper? A I'm good. I don't really have a temper. C When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? A It was my ex husband about money. C What are some things that make you really mad? A People. Lying, cheating, conniving drug addicts. You know, just ugly people. People that are hideous on the inside, you know? Ah, Jesus Christ. That's about it. My mother, when she was alive, well, she still has a positive influence, but nobody really, but Jesus. C Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? A Memorable experiences? I don't know. I can't really think of one right now. C What comes to your mind? A Gosh. Memorable experiences. Oh, I guess like maybe modeling. That was pretty cool. Yeah. C Nice. A Yeah. C Can you tell me about that? A I was just kind of surreal, like to see yourself in magazines and pictures and stuff, you know. I didn't understand how it could have been me, but then my photographer told me, he was like, well, someone has to do it. It might as well be you. So. Oh, well. And it's true. So that was cool. C What made you decide to do that? A Just kind of fell into it by accident. I've always. I'm so. Yeah. Yeah. I wish I did it. I took it further, but I couldn't. C Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? A Really happy? I don't remember. I really don't. C Okay. How would your best friend describe you? A I don't really have a best friend, but I'm sure anybody would describe me as outgoing. C That's good. A Yeah. C Have you ever served in the military? A No. C Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? A Yes. C How long ago were you diagnosed? A It was 1984. Yeah. I couldn't deal with it, so I had to see a psychiatrist. C What were your symptoms? A Horrified. Couldn't sleep. Panicked. Major anxiety. Yeah. C Did you think you had a problem before you found out? A Yeah. Yes. C Do you still go to therapy now? A Yes, I do. C Do you feel like therapy is useful? A It could be. If you see the right doctor. If You If. Yeah. C How has seeing a therapist affecting you? A It gives you the opportunity to talk to somebody and hopefully they can give you answers. Most of them don't. They try to find the answers inside of you and get it out of you. But it's just good to be able to talk to somebody that's kind of bias neutral. C How have you been feeling lately? A Really depressed. Extremely depressed. Yeah. Poverty? Yeah. C Have you noticed any changes in your behavior? A Yeah, I'm a lot more tired, I sleep longer and I just don't have the drive motivation that I did before. C How do you cope with them? A Just try to be strong. Just have to get through it, you know? C There are always trade offs in life, aren't there? A Yes, there are. C Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? A Not really. I'm an open book. C That's good. A Yeah. C What would you say are some of your best qualities? A Well, I would say a perfectionist, but that's not really a good quality because it can get dangerous. I'm just artistic. I'm good at a lot of things. I'm really good at a lot of things. Well, I'm a good hairdresser and makeup artist. I crochet and knit really well. Make jewelry. Not good with computers or phones though. Electronics. Yeah. I keep a perfect house or. Well, when I'm not depressed like this. I was a perfect wife. The perfect wife. So. Yeah. But not anymore because I'm divorced now. But it wasn't me, it was him. So can you tell me about that? He was on drugs, so he chose. The drugs were too much problems. Yeah, it does. C How hard is that? A It's really hard because it's like the drugs are his mistress. How do I. What? C How do you know them? A Who? Oh, yes. No, Well, I don't really consider myself an introvert. C Okay. Is there anything you regret? A Yeah, I have a lot of regrets. But there really wasn't anything I could do about it. So there's really no point in regretting it because you do what you do and you make a decision and then it's already done. So why regret it? Why bother? You know? C What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A Make sure that when you marry a man that you ask him if he does drugs or alcohol. That's one for sure. That was the only question I didn't ask. I didn't know there was a lot of things. A lot of stuff. I don't know, just the things that I can do that. My talents. That's it. C What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? A Well, if I can have my Starbucks and my Orange Gina. I drink Orange Gina every day. I smoke cigarettes, unfortunately, but it's always good to have those because I'm addicted to them. And then if I can eat something really good and healthy at nighttime. Well, basically, if I have something to do, if I have a goal, somewhere to go, something to do. Like today even puts me in a good mood. Yeah. Otherwise I'd be afraid that I'd stay home and just lay in bed or farm all day. I could farm for eight hours on Farmville. Yeah. C Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. A You're welcome. Nice to meet you. So I press the button. Okay. You're good. She's good. Except for, you know, it's like the one eye. Can she hear me, by the way? The one eye always kind of moves weird. Oh, does it? Yeah, it's kind of distracting. Yeah. The one. B I'll tell you more about her and why she.

"A Okay, that looks good. Okay, again, when she says goodbye, you're just going to press this button and I'll come back over, okay? B Okay. A So she'll start asking you questions. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Sure. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Good, I guess. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B New Orleans, Louisiana. A Really? When'd you move to LA? B 2005. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B I used to go back often, but not much anymore. A Why? B Ah, just things happened. A Okay. Why'd you move to la? B Well, I guess you're not programmed with this knowledge, but Katrina happened in 2005. A Wow. How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B Not really. A Can you tell me about that? B Um, where to begin? Just LA is different culturally. I have a different culture out here, it's just a different place. A What are some things you really like about la? B It's bike friendly. Louisiana isn't. New Orleans, for that matter, really isn't. Now they're trying to be, but it just, it isn't that successful. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B The drivers. They're crazy. A I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B Not really. Kind of, but not much anymore. Don't have the money. Kind of broke. A I understand. What do you enjoy about traveling? B Just being able to go on an adventure. Let's see, I. I once went to Comic Con on a bicycle, like a three wheel bike. And that was pretty fun. Kind of scary and dangerous. Nearly got killed. It was scary. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Traveling or just in general? A Whatever comes. B I gotta say, I gotta say we were, we were heading out of. We were heading off the PCH and going into Laguna and Laguna has this really steep hill and, and on Sundays it's full of traffic. And I remember going down the hill and my brakes weren't working and I was trying to hit my brakes and trying to hit my brakes and they just, they wouldn't click and I was like, oh God. And I'm on a three wheel bike, so I'm larger than most bikes. And I'm, like, zipping in between, like, gridlock traffic, going down a hill, unable to brake. And I'm going down, and suddenly there's this car that veers right into essentially where I'm trying to go. So I turn sharply in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic, through oncoming traffic, and then looping back through oncoming traffic, back into the right traffic, still without any brakes. And, like, not managing to keep my bike from rolling, which is painful when your bike rolls. Kind of hurts a lot. So. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. A What'd you study at school? B Various different things. Anthropology, visual effects. Kind of weird, but, Yeah, I just. I've always had a fascination with film, and I think the way people do things and go about things is fascinating. Just as, like, the mob mentality of people especially. Dream job, huh? I have no idea. Just a job, I guess. A Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I consider myself more outgoing. A Why? B You know, I've never been afraid of what people think of me. Like, people don't like people I don't know. I'm not afraid of what they think. I'm more concerned with, like, the people I know and what they think of me, I guess. So being outgoing just doesn't really affect me. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the festive God. What do you do to relax? B I play video games, listen to music. Yeah. Read books. I like reading books. And drawing. Reading books, drawing, playing video games. Did I think of it? Did I forget anything? Sleeping. I like sleeping. It's fun. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Uh, not good. A Has that gotten you in trouble? B Frequently. A Can you tell me about that? B Um. Uh, in high school, I shove somebody's head through a locker. Um, yeah. Yeah, that. That's not good. Don't ever shove someone's head into a locker. That's a great way to get suspended. Um, I don't know. Yeah, things like that. Just getting into fights. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Like, a serious argument, I guess, like this argument over. Over. I guess over, like. Like, viewpoints on, like, gun control and gun control laws. I mean, that was, like, yesterday evening. A How did you feel in that moment? B It was. It was an argument about, you know, gun control regulation. I mean, it doesn't really affect me personally, but that was, like, the last argument I got into. That's Kind of what you specified, I think. A Okay, tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Ooh. Um. My entire life. About two years ago, I broke up with, like, as everyone calls her, my evil axe. And, yeah, it was just. It was bad. The whole. The whole thing went down bad. I mean, I think I've calmed down a lot since then, like, just as a person, as a whole. But, I mean, I was angry and stuff. I. I think I, like, went riding my bike for, like, hundreds plus miles in a singular day, and I was in a ton of pain. Like, later in the evening, I got home, I was like, oh, God, like, I could barely walk. And, yeah, I think running off and, like, going on, like, extreme cycling spree was not good, but it was better than, like, eating too much and, like, just overeating because I was depressed. But, yeah, like, we. We fought and screamed, and it was. It was not good. Like, we didn't physically fight. It was more like a screaming match of death. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Hmm. Um. I don't think I've had a singular hard decision I've ever had to make because my. My biggest thing in life is don't, you know, don't regret. Don't regret the things you do. Just regret the opportunities you've missed. And that's, like, had to come with me. That's, like, had to. I've had to, like, learn that in the past, like, two years, like two years ago. I totally just could not grasp that concept. And to answer your question, I think thinking about it, the hardest decision I've had to make is I'd say probably. Probably to break up with my ex. Probably. Where do I begin? Um. My ex was not a good person, just in any way, shape or form of the word. She did some things that I wasn't entirely comfortable with, just to the people around her and to me. And I. You know, they say you're supposed to give. Forgive people for making mistakes or doing things. And I just. I think there's some things you can't forgive people for, no matter how hard you try. And I think there are some things that, once done, they can't be undone. They just. They're. They're the way that they are. And I think. I think after what she did, I, like, I just. That things just fell apart after that. It just. We. Despite us trying, it just. It didn't work out. I mean, I don't know. I don't really want to talk about exactly what Happened. A Okay, tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Oh, geez. Oh, man. Erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening? Huh? I don't. You know, that's hard. Um, Katrina. Just the experience of Katrina, for starters. My ex. I guess between those two, it's kind of hard. I'd actually rather lean towards Katrina because that was just. That. That was not. I mean, I guess you don't exactly know about it, but in 2005, this giant storm hit New Orleans, Louisiana. Killed a whole bunch of people, leveled the town. And I lost a lot of friends during the storm. I mean, I'm kind of. I'm getting over it, but it's still. It's. It's still there. And I think. I don't know. I mean, you can try and look at. You can try your best to try and find something positive in that, but there's just. There's nothing. The only thing you can do is just think that was, like, a freak accident and will never happen again, though. I live in la and, you know, earthquakes, they can happen. I just think, oh, I'd rather. Rather know that it's coming than not know it's coming. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Yes. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yeah. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B Depression? It's reoccurred multiple times. That's no surprise. First time I was diagnosed was in middle school, which would have been 10. Well, 10 between 10 and 12 years ago. I don't know. I don't know. Whenever I was in the sixth grade, that's why I first was told that I was depressed. As far as PTSD goes post Katrina, and then, you know, just post Katrina, mostly that was the big thing, I guess. Having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still being in high school, it kind of wasn't. I wasn't really seeking help. It's kind of. I got. I kind of got into my high school, and they were like, here's help because we know you're gonna need it. And I was like, oh, well, thanks. I didn't really ask for it, but okay, I'll take it. Um. You know, just kind of happened. A Do you still go to therapy now? B No, not. Not anymore. A Why did you stop? B Um, that's a good question. Um. Jeez. You know, I really don't know. I guess it just kind of stomped. Just kind of was like, I'm not gonna do this anymore. Sometimes. Sometimes it's a lot of, like, how are you feeling today? And stuff. And, you know, it's kind of. Well, I'm feeling fine right now, but ask me in two hours and who knows, you know? A How has seeing a therapist affected you? B Um, I guess it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happen, just happen. And to just get on and move along with your life, essentially, just, like, carry on, you know, Things will happen, carry on. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Wow. Uh, I was. I was hanging out with my girlfriend. Just hanging out. A That's so good to hear. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Um, well, for starters, I mean, you can't see when I walked in, but I'm walking with a cane right now because I got hit by a car recently, and I'd make my leg better. Let's see. Cane's over there that way. But anyway, I don't know, make myself less fat. I'd make it so I don't feel the incessant need to sleep 14 hours a day. Because when you sleep, like, more than 10 hours a day, it's just. It's unproductive. You waste too much time. Like, I have friends who are like, oh, you know, I feel rejuvenated after six hours, and I'm like, how do you do that? I have to sleep, like, 12 hours to feel good. Like, you can sleep six. You know, like in. In crunch time. You know, you can get away with four, I have to get away with seven or eight. You know, like that. That's my crunch time sleep schedule. Eight hours. It's just. I don't know. I oversleep. But I like sleeping, too. I mean. Yeah, it's just the oversleeping part I don't like so much. A Okay. How would your best friend describe you? B Utterly insane. In a good way. Utterly insane. In a good way. I guess, like, they would also say, like, you know, there are times where I might seem like an asshole. And I'm not really an asshole. I just, you know, I just have issues like everybody else. Specifically, I have Asperger's, so that's a form of autism that just kind of makes life awesome. They'd also say I'm flamboyant and eccentric, because I totally am. I just. I don't know, I figure I'm still alive, so I should live because I'm still alive. And, you know, who knows how long I'm gonna be alive for? So I should, you know, live while I'm alive and just go out and do stuff and not. Not sit and be Calm. Except when I'm reading, and I like reading. A Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Stop fucking up. No, that's kind of messed up. I think I would have told myself at the time, because I've known my. My evil ex. I've known her since, like, I was, like, 6 and she was 5. I think 10 years ago, I would have grabbed myself by the shoulders and say, you see that girl? Whatever you do, do not date that girl. Don't trust her. She can't be trusted. And more importantly, don't. Don't let your guard down around her, because she'll. She'll exploit that. And I mean, like, physically let your guard down, not mentally. Yeah, don't. Don't date her. Just don't do it. It's not worth it. It's not worth the trouble. It's not worth the pain. It's not worth it. A Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? B The fact that I'm still alive, maybe. Yeah. I don't know. Cycling to Comic Con, I was pretty proud of that. Pretty proud that I managed to do it. Just, I don't, you know, I don't really know. I don't really use the term pride. I don't really feel pride. I'm just. It's more of, like, the fact that I'm still alive. I'm proud to be alive. I don't know if that makes me humble or just insane. Who knows? A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. B Do I press the button now? Oh, bye. Okay. By the way, her eyes are really creepy. Oh, just saying that. A Is it just the way that they. B They.

"A All right. And I'm gonna do something that looks a little funny. B So now I'm gonna start at the. A Virtual human and she's gonna chat with. B You for a bit. Okay. A When she's done, she'll let you know. She'll say bye. B Okay. And I'm gonna give you the doorbell again and you can ring that one. Okay. Excellent. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm okay. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B Here? Los Angeles. A Really? What are some things you really like about la? B There's a lot of things to do. I love the beach. I love that it's sunny all the time. The amount of people. That's really about it. The amount of people. A Do you travel a lot? B Just a little. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B I just like going to new places and just discovering new things. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B I recently went to New York. I was there for about three months and it was extremely boring. I went to Western New York and it was extremely snowy and I was in a position where I didn't have a car, so I didn't get to go very many places. And I was in a small town, so it was beautiful for what I got to see. But really, there wasn't really much to it. Yeah. A Do you consider yourself an introvert? B Both. I'm both an introvert and an extrovert. I really enjoy doing things by myself. I have a lot of my own, my likes and dislikes, and I spent a lot of time alone, even though I do have a lot of friends. And when I do go out, I do tend to meet a lot of people. But I also enjoy being by myself a lot. A Okay. How would your best friend describe you? B Probably outgoing, creative, talented, fun, trustworthy. A What did you study at school? B I studied language and physics and math. No, I'm not. I'm actually. I'm trying to be an actress. A How did you decide to do that? B It was something that I fell into when I was a teenager and I really enjoyed doing it and I hadn't done it for years, so I figured, why not? I just came back to California and I might as well, try something that I did enjoy really doing. Are you happy you did that so far? I just got picked up by an agent, so I haven't really done anything yet as an adult. But I'm hoping, Hoping something. It'll be fruitful. A Some of it's been a positive influence in your life. B I really don't. Haven't had too many, I guess. My sister, she's done really well. My boyfriend, he's a very positive human being. But really, I haven't had too many positive influences. A How close are you to your family? B I'm close. I mean, we hang out. I don't tell them everything. They're kind of judgmental, but other than that, I mean. I mean, we hang out. I mean, I see them every day. A What do you do to relax? B Geez, it's kind of hard for me when you relax. I mean, I try to watch TV and I read a lot. That's probably about it. I read. I do a lot of sleeping. I'm a little depressed, so, yeah, it's kind of. Like I said, it's really hard for me to relax. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B It isn't. I tend to think a lot about the things that stress me out. I've been through a lot of. A lot of stuff. So. Yeah, so I don't sleep very well at night. And if I do fall asleep, I wake up all through the night, usually with some kind of anxiety attacks. A Are you triggered by something? B I dream a lot about the stuff that has. Has affected me throughout the years. So it's. Usually I'll dream about something that stressed me out and then I'll wake up and my chest will hurt or just. I just can't sleep all night because I just think. I seem to be. I don't know if I'm afraid to go to sleep, but I. I just. I don't know. I feel like that's a vulnerable place for me because of stuff that have happened to me. So sleeping is just not really something I do well. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B Tired. I'm moody. I'm very sensitive. I'm just a negative person, which really. That's not me. I. Yeah, judgmental is not me either. I just. I'm just not a nice person to be around. A How do you cope with them? B I tried. I spend a lot of my time reading. I try to go out and do. I force myself to go out and do things just to keep myself involved so that I Don't just sit around and dwell on the fact that I can't sleep. And I try to get myself as exhausted as I possibly can by running around and doing things. A How hard is that? B It's difficult. I do. Like, there is a part of me that doesn't want to. I don't really want to go out and do things. I have to actually force myself to. If I have make appointments, I. I make appointments to, like, for auditions or even to do this. I am. I tend to just not, like, at the last minute, I'll try to convince myself not to go, but then I force myself to anyways. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Yes. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B I've been diagnosed for two instances. I was diagnosed about three or three and a half years ago, and then I was diagnosed again in August. A What got you to seek help. B The first time? It was. I just wasn't because of the not sleeping and the. Just the unbelievable stress. And then the second time, it was once again I started with the not sleeping. And then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me. And I just. I just couldn't take it anymore. So I figured I was getting too gloomy. I was getting, like, not thinking life was worth it. And I. That's. I just needed to see somebody before anything escalated. Yeah, it was. Do you still go to therapy now? I do not. A Why did you stop? B One of the reasons I went to New York was to try to get out of my environment. And. And that seemed to help a lot. And out here I was. I just. The counselors that I was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much. They just. They just seem to be giving me a lot of medications, and I don't believe that that's what I needed. Yeah. So, yeah, stressed. Lately, I've been really sad. And I don't know why, but like I said, I've been trying to combat that by keeping myself busy. A When was the last time you felt really happy? B Actually, I'm kind of a couple days ago. I was actually really happy, and it was genuinely happy. But then it went back to being, you know, going back to feeling miserable. So can you tell me about that? Well, I realized I got up in the morning. I actually did get a good night of sleep, and I realized that I'm actually really lucky because I've been through a lot in my life, and I have somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who is finally there for me and, you know, gives Me what I need emotionally, and I was just really thankful for that, and that made me really happy. That's so good to hear. Yeah. Thank you. A What are you most proud of in your life? B Oh, geez. I've had so many years of just. Just bad. Just a lot of bad that. It's been a long time since I've been proud of anything. I guess, if anything, it's my ability to survive through all the hardships I've been through. A lesser person, I guess, would have gotten rid of themselves a long time ago. But even though, like, I'm really depressed and I feel gloomy and I just feel miserable about a lot of things, there's got to be a silver lining. So. So, yeah. So, I mean, I guess that's what I'm proud of. Although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me, it hasn't ruined me. I still try to be a good person. I try not to be negative towards other people and truthful. And I still have drive in me. A That's great. B Yeah. A Is there anything you regret. B So much? My last marriage, not getting out when I should have, and just. I regret a lot. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. B That any situation that would have had a red flag, just get out of it. You know, Some things just don't work. And no matter how hard you try, no matter how much you put into it. So I would tell myself to. That it's not selfish to let go of a bad situation. And not everybody can be helped. So sometimes you just got to live for yourself and help yourself. So had I known that then, had I known that, then I probably would have done better in life. So. A I see what you mean. B Yeah. A What are some things that make you really mad? B People who. When people are down on me for my faults that I have done, that I have things that I have done in my past that people still relive when I'm trying to forgive myself. People who are mean to other people, people who talk poorly about people behind their backs, people that are untrustworthy. Just anybody who picks on the little guy, you know, people who don't care about the environment or animals. I think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be. And it's disheartening. And it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people. Don't let people live. People try to make everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do, and that makes me mad. A What do you do when you're annoyed? B I vent. Yeah. I Tend to vent. And then. And then. And then it's usually over. I try not to badmouth people. I try to just talk through it until. Until it's gone, and then it doesn't bother me anymore. A That's good. How are you at controlling your temper? B I try not to get angry because I have a really bad temper, and it. And it can get out of hand. So what I do is something gets me so mad, I tend to go and take a nap. If I'm not in that situation where I can just go and take a nap, I usually just walk away from the situation and I try to clear my mind and come back to it. A Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B It was a couple days ago. It was actually with my mother. It was about. Actually, she thought that I had taken a shirt from her and she was screaming and yelling at me, and I was tired. I was. It was late. And I started to yell back at her because I was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty. And it's going back to my past when I was younger and I didn't care about people's things, and I would just kind of take and do whatever I wanted to, and I'm not. I'm so far from that person, and it hurt me. So I got mad and I started to yell and argue, kind of petty and stupid. But at the time, it seemed viable. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Hmm. One of my most memorable experiences. I've had so many. Maybe it was. I don't know. Um. It was probably graduating pharmacy school. A That's great. How did you feel in that moment? B I felt pretty great. I didn't know if I was doing very, very well or not. And I ended up getting, like, all my last test scores. I ended up getting, like 98%. And I actually. I had no confidence that I had done it well in class and school at all. And I didn't even know how I was getting the grades I was getting. So that was a really big accomplishment for me. And. Yeah, that was a great. It was a great memory. Yeah. A Awesome. B Yeah. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm reliable. I'm talented. I'm a good listener. I'm always there to help people. I tend to always try to do the right thing. Sometimes, actually, I forget that I have any good qualities, but I'm just all around. I try to be as good and the best person that I can be to other people and myself. Yeah. A What are some things that usually put you in a good mood. B Going to comedy shows, just having moments where you just laugh with people. Sometimes just reading puts me in a good mood. I don't know. Probably. That's about it. Okay. A I think I've asked everything I need to. B Okay. A Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Thank you. A Goodbye. B Bye.

"Now our virtual human will enter. Okay, I'll start it. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine, just a little tired. Where are you from? B I'm really from Texas. This is where I went to my whole school and I was a military kid. What are the things you really like at? B I really like the city size. I mean literally. It looks like there is something to do. I just would like to have the energy to go out and do it. What are the things you don't really like at it? B Traffic, pollution. R do you travel a lot? B Excuse me? What is one of your most memorable experiences? B oh, let's see. Really, my memory is not really great. Lately, I thought a lot about what I was in Japan when I was a child going up to the Mount Zuma camp. What did you study at school? B studied X Ray technology. I was X Ray technician for a few years until I lost my license because of drug addiction. What are you doing now? B I'm now retired. I really don't do anything. I wouldn't mind working again, but I would lose my advantages if I do. So, with the economy being what it is, there is not much to do. At uh huh. What is your dream work? B I'm sorry? Do you consider yourself more shy or out? B I am a fairly shy person. Find it difficult to make friends. Lots of confidence problems, I guess. One why? B I don't really do it. No, I guess the experiences of my past. A Tell Me on your relationship with your family. B really? Our family has never been very close. I mean we were a military family. About everyone has done their own thing. I mean that we all gathered to sit on avenue every night, but he generally watched television. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I like to watch a lot of movies. Just stretch out my tilting chair. How are you going to control your temperament? B In fact, I don't really have much temperament. In a way, he takes a lot to trigger me. Regarding anger, so I don't really have a problem with my temperament. A it's good. When was the last The time you argued with someone and what was it? B WOW. The last argument with someone was actually yesterday was just something stupid about individuals who are not medically trained to put your backpack in place, cracking your spine. A MM. Tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. Everything that comes to mind. B Well, my life saw me when I was in the army. I went out with this very good woman. I would like me to never have broken the relationship with her. I mean, I think my life would have taken a completely different direction if I had stayed with her. R which you feel guilty? B I feel guilty for the way I broke her with her. Let it come here from Virginia to Texas, where I stayed at the time, then left the bomber that I do not think that we have a future together. To Tell Me on the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. B I don't know. A good. B I. I can't really think of any. Nothing. I mean. To Tell Me on an event or something you want to be able to erase from your memory. B I want me to risk all this time that I was there to take drugs and to screw my life, which I have never even started. Have you ever served in the army? B Yeah, I spent 11 years in the army. I went down after the. When they were removing after the first Gulf War, Desert Storm. At what age were you when you joined the army? B I'm sorry, I did not understand the question very well. I am a little more difficult to hear. I'm sorry, I didn't catch. I was talking about when you were preparing to speak. Are you happy that you did that? B am I happy with my thoughts? Not really. It seems that often, it is just to fill empty, as if I really don't think about anything. It's just nice. I feel like I am on the automatic driver. Have you ever seen fights? B no. I did. I have never seen a fight. I was supposed to deploy there, but when my deployment rolled, the war was already over. A good. How easy for you to go back to civilian life? B In fact, it was quite easy. I mean, I was hardly busy and I already knew what I wanted to do. Go to X Ray school, get my diploma, start. Start being an X Ray technician, which I did. So I have somehow fucked up that by getting involved with drugs. A good. What did you do after the army? B well, I went back to school full time. I mean, I had a starting indemnity when I went out, so I was able to go ahead and pay my rent for the two years Ars I was at school. I didn't have to work or care. I just lived from my GI bill. The dressage was quite easy. I mean, from time to time. There were points in the times I missed. I missed the camaraderie. A I am sorry. How did the army service change you? B well, I mean, it gave me more concentration. I was ready to go back to school, which I couldn't. I could have gone to university as soon as I was a high school. I was just tired from school when the army helped me calm down and organize my thoughts and made me concentrate to go back to school. How have you been feeling lately? B How can I feel lately? To tell me about it. B recently, I have just been a little tired, exhausted. I don't know. I just don't have the impression of having energy to really do anything. R Have you noticed these latest changes in your behavior or your thoughts? B The changes are. As I said, it seems that recently, I just can't start motivated to do anything. I’m not sure with people, but I don’t like to be with many people lately. And I try. Trying to get out of this, but it's not always easy. I am a bit irritated. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B well, when I take my serum, who is almost every night, I sleep pretty well. Only only get up or twice a night to use the toilet. But I'm just. What do you like when you don't sleep? A well. B I just slide. I don't want to do anything. I'm usually just. I don't sleep in a bed. I sleep in a tilting chair, and I stay almost in my tilting chair all day and my head when I watch TV. A good. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B Yes, I was recently diagnosed in the past year with the SSPT. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B Yeah, I have been diagnosed with depression for several years now. As I said, it's. I don't know what. Maybe I get used to my medication or what's going on, but I really felt, I suppose, below. For how long you have been diagnosed where depression. It's been about three years, three and a half years when I lived in Riverside. What were your symptoms? B Lack of energy, insomnia, constant concern. Are they triggered by something. B I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question. Can you tell me? B UM, as I said, I didn't do it. I am a little difficult to hear and I really did not address the question. How do you face them? B UM, how can I face my. Assuming You answer how I face my feelings. Um. As I said, I'm just. There is not much to do. I'm just taking care of them. I don't know I have real adaptation skills that I use. I mean, I try not to focus on negatives and things like that, but I don't focus on positive points either. What made you ask for help? B What made me ask for help? In fact, I owed my addiction to drugs. I lived in the street and I finally woke up one day was just tired. I ended up going to a riverside refuge where I discovered that I would have advantages to come and that's where I started to get help. Are you going to always in therapy now? B I see my. I see a psychiatrist every six to eight weeks. So yes, I actually do it. I am very satisfied with the doctor I have here. The VA of Long Beach actually takes time to listen to.

"A So now I'm going to bring Mr. Robert back over here and when she's done, she'll let you know and you can press that button. B Okay? A Thank you. B You're welcome. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm good. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B Michigan. A Really? When did you move to la? B Two years ago. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B Every three months. A How does it compare to la? B It's more homey and country than fast paced and stuff. A Why did you move to la? B I work in the entertainment business so I had to be out here. A How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B It was pretty easy because I lived in New York first and if you can survive New York, you could survive la. A I see what you mean. What are some things you really like about la? B The weather, of course. Beaches. The people are much ruder and mean than what I'm used to. But I like la. A What did you study at school? B Graphic design. Media arts. A That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? B In high school I was ahead in all my classes and credits so I had to take a college course. So while in high school I got a two year college degree. Doing it because I was good at it. Yeah, but now I want to go into something else. I'm in school actually. I take online classes now for business management. A What's your dream job? B I am really. One day I want to own. Me and my sisters want to own our own rental properties and like a real estate company. We own six houses now. We bought with our college money and now we want to eventually one day own our own homes and apartment complexes. A That's great. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B Yeah. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Meeting new people. Seeing different things that you've never seen before. Different languages, everything. Just seeing what the world has to offer. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B Oh, okay. Me and my sisters went to Hawaii last year and I believe we went to Honolulu and then Hawaii. Yeah. And we met the people in Hawaii and They were so nice. If I could live there, I would. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Everything was memorable, but probably jet skiing in Honolulu was very fun. A Awesome. B Yeah. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Outgoing. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B Music. Music is much therapy for me. A Can you tell me about that? B Well, my family is very musically inclined, like my dad and my mom's family. So music has always been like that thing. No matter how I feel, if I put music on, it makes it much better. A That's so good to hear. How are you at controlling your temper? B I'm pretty good. I used to box, so it let out a lot of frustration. So sometimes I do that too. I go to the gym and I do, like, a kickboxing class, but I don't. I never escalated to the point where I, like, blurred out or. No, I can control it pretty much. A Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Well, I live with my sister, so I argue every day, but it was over clothes. My sister and clothes is always close. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B My mother and my father are pastors of a church. I grew up with two sisters and an older brother who was a cop. And we're pretty close. I have a nephew. We're pretty close. Like every day we see each other close. And we don't all live in the same house, but we're together every single day at some point when we lived in Michigan. My family is in Michigan. A Great. What's something you feel guilty about? B When I cheat. Like, right now I'm on a diet with my sisters, but last night I snuck and got McDonald's, so I feel bad because they've been so sticking to it. And I cheated, but that's pretty much it. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. B Um. Hmm. Me and my. When me and my. A friend of mine got into it and we said things that weren't, like, we hit below the belt that we. And we usually don't. And we haven't spoken in, like, three months now. And I know that it could have been prevented if we would have just sat down and talked to each other, but it didn't make it that far. So. Yeah. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Um, probably moving here, Moving to la because, like, I'm I'm really, like. We're really close to our family. Like, I Skype with my mom and dad every day, so it was hard to go from there to here and them taking care of everything. To me and my sisters having to do it on our own, it was much. It was different. A Yeah. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Oh, my goodness. My parents, my brother, my dad, my mom, my sisters, my family. I have a great family, so my family, definitely. A Okay, tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B I want to say, two years ago, three years ago, my brother was shot on duty and he almost lost his life. But he didn't. And for some reason, as much as I try, I don't tell them this because I don't want them to be like, I need to, you know, whatever. But I always think about it over and over again, and I'll cry about it like it happened yesterday, but it happened three years ago. Just the mere fact of almost losing him. Kinda. Yeah. A That sounds really hard. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Not easy. I work as a personal assistant and administrative assistant for a casting agent, so I'm on call for her whenever, so I'm never. I never get a good night's sleep ever. A That sucks. B I know. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B I'm a zombie. I'm pretty much. You would never know, because when it's work, I'm professional, so if I am tired, they never know. But I'm very annoyed and very grouchy when I'm having sleep. A Okay. How have you been feeling lately? B Tired. And I have crazy headaches, but that's probably from not getting enough sleep and working too much. But, yeah, very tired. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts or. B Yeah, definitely. A Like what? B I'm shorter with people. Like, being in the industry. I mean, people don't really care. It's all about self. And when I first came here, I had the personality and attitude of family and love and nice. And being here showed me that everybody's kind of out for self here, even though, like, the other girls I work with. So I've learned to, like, cut people off and be short with people when that's not really me. But I just see that's how you have to be. A Yeah. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Last Saturday. I did a weigh in and I lost seven pounds. I was, like, excited. So that was the last time. A That's great. How would your best friend describe you? B Care too much? I think about others more than myself. So she'd probably say, I care too much. I'm loving. I'm the person that every friend I have confided in from best friend to just regular friend. So, yeah, I'm the mom of my friends. A Is there anything you regret? B Um, no. No, I don't regret anything. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Hmm. Never take no for an answer. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Um, I wish I could. Well, I don't know. Personally, I want to lose, like, 20 more pounds, but just, I don't know, be a little more adventurous. A little more adventurous. A Mm. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. B Um, I don't think I've had a time made me feel bad. No, I can't. No, I don't think I have one. I'm sorry. I don't think I have one. A Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B Oh, well, me and my sisters have just started with yoga, and we already do the beach like every Friday. But yoga is like our new addiction, so we do yoga and we probably go to, like, a spa or something. That's an idea. Yeah. A What do you most proud of in your life? B My job, My career.

"R So we are just going to move, make sure that it takes up you. We go there. Now we are going to do something that will synchronize our equipment. In fact, I will do this time to make sure we can hear it. We go there. Now, I raise our virtual human conversation with her. And I'm going to give you the doorbell when you've finished talking. When she says goodbye. If you just want to hit this. B ring and let me know, I will come back. A thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to answer. B yeah. So how are you today? I'm fine, Arizona. Because of the game and other things. Do you like the entertainment industry? No, not for the moment, at least. Well, I'm currently a student. I produce hip hop. Well, I rap and produce hip hop. I play video games and spend time with people. Do you consider yourself an introvert? B no. Not very good to break things. On the way here. My mom and how to get here. A I am sorry. What are the things you really like? B The beach. It makes sense. He's a computer guy. No, the last place I went was Los Cabo. No, not Los Cabos. Where do I have? Somewhere in Mexico. No, no. Yes. Like four years. A good. B you feel right now? No, lately? Not very easy. No, just lately. Well, my wife left three weeks ago. And after that, I couldn't sleep. I'm not only buried my head and all that. I don't know, I'm just doing things. I try to keep my mind away. Like yoga and other things. Keep my mind out of everything I don't have. I never went to therapy. Wait, no, I went to therapy like three, four years ago because I went to a separate therapist, but then I went to something where they did a bunch of cognitive tests and memory tests. And then she diagnosed me with a type of depression that lasts a long time. As if I am depressed and it lasts for months. Yeah. To be honest, I don't know. I think it's more like, you focus on yourself and that you like. I don't know. I don't know how to explain this. It's like you have to find things in you. You don't need someone else to talk. Well, originally, when I went to see the therapist, I was ordered court. Now I want to go to therapy for my anger management, however. A good. What were your symptoms? B I don't know what the . I mean, my wife left three weeks ago, then. Yes. This is probably the most difficult thing I have ever done, then. Yeah. Well, since I am only 19 years old, if I could go back 19 years, I would say not to fuck and to be depressed some things that would have removed my wife and not be angry. Is there something you regret? B yeah. Ride my wife? Yes, a lot, a lot. Every day. Well, I couldn't have broken stuff and I could have stopped. For example, I essentially blocked the external universe and I put everything in myself and loved to focus on other things so that I do not focus on real life. I mainly escaped. And so in this sense, I was not paying attention to her. And that's essentially why she left. I mean, that and be angry is how both have contributed to their own proportion, their own portion. R when is the last time you felt really happy? B earlier during the day. I mean, I feel really happy all the time and then it's okay. It's like back and forth. Like a day, a second, I will be really happy and then another, I will be really sad because I will think again of something. It is as if I had to keep my mind of things and love to go ahead and love to think and. I don't really know how to explain it. This is just something you feel. No, you need better programming. Uh, idiot. Do you know that you are some of your best qualities? B I am a creative potential of intelligence. I am charming, I like. At times, I am all these things. At times, I don't do yoga and don't play video games and I do my wife around my hip hop. I mean, traveler for children, you need better programming. The children's traveler is my friend. To be a hip hop artist, I don't know. I just started one day. Harder. I mean, it was difficult when I trained, when I was younger, when I was 11 or 12 years old. Now it's just easy. I'm still at school. No problem. A thank you. It was great to chat with you. B yeah. Have a good day. Bye. Bye. I'm not going to hear the sound. I started clicking twice and I'm like, I'm not going to hear the sound. A thanks for that.

"A So like a really long, long period of time. Go ahead and press that button. It could indicate that something's gone wrong. Wrong with the system. It's not very typical that that happens. But just in case, I kind of have to give you a warning so that you don't sit in here kind of going, what's going on? So if it's, you know, I'd say 30 seconds or more. If you notice that, press that button. B Gotcha. A Okay, so now I'm going to bring up our virtual human. C She's going to come off the in here. I'm going to go ahead and insert the camcorder recording. B For real. C Okay. A I'm going to go ahead and start her up. C Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yeah. C Okay. So how are you doing today? B All right. C Where are you from originally? B Inland Empire. C What are some things you really like about la? B Just got here. I'm not too sure. Good. Buildings. C What are some things you don't really like about la? B There's a lot people obnoxious. Getting around. It's kind of a headache, but it's alright. Buses are pretty good. C I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? B Yes, in a way. C What do you enjoy about traveling? B Different sceneries, different places, different people. C I'd like to hear about one of your trips. B Well, going to North Carolina. Mainly to do with the military, but none recently. C What's one of your most memorable experiences? B I don't think I have one. Not anymore. C Whatever comes to your mind. B I guess. Going overseas. C What do you study at school? B Studying solar panel technology. I'm currently studying right now. C What do you do now? B Student. C Okay. What's your dream job? B Own my own business. And what? I don't know yet, but something working for myself. C Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Both. C Tell me about your relationship with your family. B It's not good right now. I don't really talk to them. Certain situations came up, I don't really talk to them. C Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the festive guy. What do you do to relax? B Gym. I go to the gym, let off tension Stress. Anything that I can possibly do. One thing I know, going to the gym. It's the only thing I really got right now that relieves anything that I have. C How are you at controlling your temper? B Not sure I can control it at times. Sometimes it'll get out of control. C The last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B My girlfriend. We argued pretty good. It was about why I don't call her enough. And when I wasn't calling her enough, it got pretty bad. C Hmm. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B There's a lot of them. C Whatever comes to your mind. What's something you feel guilty about? B Guilty? There's a lot of things I feel guilty about. A lot of them I don't want to even talk about. But being close to my family is one of the things that I never did. And I. And I'm. And I regret that. C Mm. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Actually, there was a lot of decision. Hard decisions that I made, but I never made them. I can say what? You could say I took the easy way out. Maybe. C All right. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Don't know. C Have you ever served in the military? B Yes. C Okay. How have you been feeling lately? B Alright. Then again, not good. C Tell me more about that. B It's hard to explain. Don't know how to even start it. Ups down, depression, dealing with going back to school, money. You can say I hit rock bottom and I'm starting my life over again. C Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B Yeah. That's because I'm no longer doing things that I ain't supposed to do. But it's hard. C Can you tell me about that? B Well, from a previous addict. Why did I get to that? I don't know. I'm not even too sure. All I know is that I was just doing the wrong things at the wrong time. Got me into so much trouble. Now I'm starting over because I lost everything. But I'm happy about how I'm starting now. It's slow, but it's kind of like an adventure at the same time. But there's a lot of things that I'm thinking about as well. A lot of things that I can't forget. C How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B I can't. I'm under sleep meds. Two types. And sometimes I can't even fall asleep. It'll take. I can't Take more than I am prescribed. But I have problems sleeping. C I'm sorry. Why? B I really don't know why. Bad dreams, past events, thoughts that keep on popping up. Bad mood, depression. I'm not too sure. C What are you like when you don't sleep well? B Irritable, on edge. You can say sometimes I'll be walking around, like if I'm tense, if I'm worried about something, more or less worried about falling asleep and why I'm not sleeping. C All right. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B I believe so, yes. Just currently. Not too long ago. Currently filing my claim. C Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yes. That's one thing I've been diagnosed with for sure. I don't like it. I hate it. I don't know if I can pull out of it. I don't even think the medication that I'm even using even helps. I'm still trying to get. Try different ones. Apparently there's enough out there that I can go through. C How long ago were you diagnosed? B Maybe more than a year ago. About a year ago. For my depression. C What were your symptoms? B Isolation. Not really talking with anybody. I wouldn't really be so like a people person. Communication was at an all time low. I would be mainly staying at the house. I wouldn't be going out. I wouldn't be doing events or doing the things that I would like to do. That also goes along with my addiction as well. C Are they triggered by something? B That's one thing I can't figure out is what the hell triggered them. Why am I like this? Why am I actually doing the things or did the things that I do or did? Becoming an addict, not communicating well with my family. I wasn't like this before. C How do you cope with them? B I don't know. The only thing I got on my side is the gym. It's the one place that I know I can release a lot of tension. The one place where I know I don't have to talk to people. But we're all together there doing the same thing. We're all doing the same thing. Exercising, getting physically well. It's the only place where I know that I can relax. C What got you to seek help? B Certain events that took place. I lost certain loved ones. I lost certain relation. I lost a relationship. I don't talk to my family. I think I said that already. Got in trouble with the law. Yeah, it is. C Do you still go to therapy now? B Yes, I go to a couple of them. C Emma, do you feel therapy is useful? B Sometimes. Sometimes not, depending what the topic Is. Or we're probably talking about the same thing over again. C Okay. What sort of changes? What changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? B The changes that I've noticed maybe a little bit less stress, knowing that I have a couple more skills or tools to cope with my depression, ptsd, not knowing when I'm gonna have an outburst, controlling myself here and there. But it's a long process. Also on my recovery. It's going to be a forever process. C That's good. When was the last time you felt really happy? B When I made up with my girlfriend. That was, what, two days ago. We argued and I talked about it with her, and she was able to hear me out, and I was able to hear her out, and we fixed things. So that was the happiest moment so far. C That's great. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B My case managers, down to my group sessions and my girlfriend. Even though as much of a bitch she is, she's still a good person. C How would your best friend describe you? B He asks. Well, I have one best friend right now. And it's funny that you asked because now that I remember, he. He referred me as a saint, which I don't think I do that. I don't think I am that. But I'm sure what he's trying to say is that I'm a good person and I'm trying to do right, and I don't want to inflict harm on nobody, and I just want to get myself put back together and continue on, you know, start a new life. Yeah, he did tell me something like that, and I do consider him my best friend. Pretty cool that he said that. C Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Recently. What? I really enjoyed fishing. I went with my friend Mikey fishing. We caught a couple fish. Very quiet, very fun, kind of. You got to be patient. But it is relaxing. It does take the edge off. No one there to talk to, no one there to be around. Out in the open. Yeah, that's it. C What are you most proud of in your life? B That's yet to come. I'm waiting for it. C Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B You're welcome. C Goodbye. B Virtual.

"At there I am. B If you can just move your arms a little and see a small stick silhouette appear. This is there. Why does she look like someone I know? Sorry. No problem. B I think it's probably good. A good. All right. B Thank you. A good. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? A yes, I'm fine. B So how are you today? A I am good. I'm a little tired, but I'm fine. B is good. Where do you come from? A Michigan. I come from Michigan. B When did you move to the? A long time ago. Then I left once, twice a year. B How does he compare himself to the? A cold. Very cold. B Why did you move to the? R because I wanted to continue my acting career. B It seems interesting. How did you decided to do this? A well was not a difficult decision. It was right. It was time, it was the opportunity, it was the options. More options. B How easy for you to get used to living in it? Driving was pain in the ass. Not so easy. B What are the things you really like at the? Let's see. Besides the weather, I like things to be more practical. I like some of the people here who are actually at home. But yes, I just like it, it's a bit relaxed. That's almost everything. B What are the things you don't really like at it? R I don't like traffic. I don't like gang violence in certain areas. And I don't like. What does I like no other? Eh? Maybe that's all I don't like. You know, I don't like that it is so far from home. I wish. I want it to be a little midwest. I hope that it is not so far from my home. B tell me about your relationship with your family. R I have a close relationship with my family. He's a little. The immediate family is really small and we are close. My grandmother recently died, so it's an adjustment. RIGHT. Right away. But I'm close to my family. B ok. I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? A well, I don't see your shoes, but I travel often. I travel, yes. B What do you get dressed in travel? To get there. I like to get there. Once I am wherever I go, I like to do the tourist thing, get to know places and people. B I would love to hear about one of you R Voyages. A good. Oh, I went to France a few years ago, well, many years ago, and a small town called Carcassonne. And was very. It was actually really fun, but just like a story book with regard to what I expected to see and what I really saw. For example, what I remembered that I really enjoyed is that the night when everyone is closing, as there are no windows in buildings, but there are these shutters that most places in the United States have inside the windows. They have them outside the windows, and there is no glass, so you are just closed. And it seems that everything is abandoned. For example, buildings are abandoned. So cool enough. I like that. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A I am at the limit. Sometimes I am shy, sometimes I am out. It depends on who and the situation. B ok. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? A UM, music. I turn on music. I walk in the neighborhoods, do you know? B ok. How are you going to control your temperament? R I'm good enough to control my temperament. I am. I am not at all a head of the head. B is good. When will you go back the last time you argued with someone? And what was it? An HMM? Oh, he was an ex -roommate, and it was my loyalty as ani. B Can you tell me? Yeah, roughly. She thought that because I wanted my rent, that she agreed to pay, that I was not a good friend, that I should let her live for free, and that was not going to happen. So you know, loyalty has come to let you stay anyway or let it stay anyway, even after it has not paid me. So he's a friend. I could have expelled it. I didn't do it. She left at the time agreed after she let me know that she was not going to pay. But, you know, she could have. Could have been a bad situation, but there was an argument there. A real. A real one. B tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. A I would like to have managed this situation differently and that I followed my first spirit when we agreed to be temporarily roommates and that I got my money in advance. This is what I would have liked to do. And I'm just. I didn't do it. My mind told me to accompany him. No, my mind told me to get the money in advance, but I didn't do it. SO. B tell me about the most difficult decision. Decision that you must have made. The most difficult decision? I think I have not yet made the most difficult decision, but so far, as maybe leaving the house. Leavin G at home when I was. Years ago, when I was, like 18 years old, yes. B How did you feel at that time? R I felt like I gave up my family. This is what I felt. But they encouraged me to continue and live my life. B is good. A MM. B tell me about an event or something you want you to erase from your memory. A Ah, something I could erase from my memory. Probably a friend I got out with. I would like to erase from my memory how he replied when I told him that my grandmother was sick. B how easy it is. So that you have a good night's sleep? A It's easy if I am busy all day and I am really, really tired, but in fact, my mind turns, so it's not that easy. In fact, it's not that simple. I should do it because I have to be exhausted. I must be exhausted. It seems really difficult to be exhausted. No, it's not really difficult. You do a lot all day. B How are you when you don't sleep well? An irritable. B ok. How do you feel recently? A high and downward. I was from top to bottom. For example, sometimes I am excited and anxious, and outside, I am like, what am I doing? Are B triggered by something? A yeah, just an anxiety of wanting to move certain things, goals and. B like, what? A certain type of work and having a certain amount of income and just take care of myself, you know, the way I think I should take care of myself. Just physical things, eat well and everything. B Have you noticed these changes in your behavior or your thoughts lately? Yeah, I have it. B Can you tell me? A sometimes, I have a lot of distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what I have to focus in the moment, and I am aware of it. I am like, of all the things that come to my head, why do I think of that? B How do you face it? R I let them arrive. And then I try to think about other things and eliminate it. He returns. I look at him. Yeah. B Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? A number B Have you received a diagnosis of depression? A number B tells me about the last time you felt really happy. In Uh, when the roommate has moved. I was really happy when she finally left. B tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Probably a reading. And maybe I'm going to dance. It would be ideal. If I can go dance. Go dancing salsa and. Yeah. B What are the things you want to be able to change about you? A MMM, my ability to make a decision more quickly and to act on it. B tell me once When someone made you feel really bad about yourself. A really evil. I don't know if I have some time that someone ever made me feel really bad. I don't feel bad about a lot. B ok. How would your best friend describe you? In uh, as courageous. It would be in a word. B ok. Is there something you regret in general? I regret not having made different decisions when I was younger. Regarding the future, with regard to career stuff and relational things. I would like to have done things earlier in my life that I do now. B Can you give me an example? A really after some of my personal goals and decide to be really in a relationship. It's long -term and yes, I would have liked to have done it earlier.

I became angry with someone because I didn't think they were. They gave me clear instructions. And so when I tried to have a conversation on this subject, they became crazy, then I went crazy and we got crazy. I felt like I was not heard or listened to, and I felt like we could not have a real dialogue. So, because we couldn't have a dialogue, I felt like nobody listened to me. Yeah, it sucks. B totally. To tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B I, I. No regrets? No. I guess I don't know if there is one. I mean, I'm sure there are, but once I was driving behind someone and they cut me off. And I think that is only one of these days. It was a year or two years ago. It was only one of those days when I just didn't want to. Or I'm just. It was a frustrating day. And when this person cut me off and I almost had an accident with them, I just followed them to their parking space, and in fact I had honked them, and them. They overthrew me. And so it's really, really under my skin, that someone cuts me off and would almost cause an accident and then. And then I turn around. So me. I followed them in the place and asked. I said, miss, why did you return me when you cut me? And. And she said, oh, you know, I am. I had a difficult day. I don't need your attitude. And her daughter was with her, and I told her, well, you don't really give the very good example for your daughter. And, you know, I didn't need to be mean like that, but I'm just. I wanted to be, I suppose. One yeah. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to make. B ooh, look at yourself in depth. I guess the most difficult decision was to get out to my mother, telling her that I was gay. I mean, it was not difficult because it was the right one, but it was difficult to do because my mother was very conservative and her. She had trouble accepting it. And it took a while, but once she did it, you know, everything was better. And I knew that would be the case, but it was just difficult for, you know, tell her something she didn't want to hear. When I was a little child, my. My grandfather found our dog running on the. On the road, and him. And brought it. And I remember when I was a child, just like, to see death like it really threw me and scares me. And it was just one of those moments for which I suppose that I would not have been there because my grandmother was destroyed. She was so sad and just one of those moments, I guess you need children. But I didn't really want to live, like a loss like that on your face. Yeah. A Tell Me on your relationship with your family. B My relationship with my family is pretty good. We are probably not as close as most, but we know, we are still. We are not talking about often, but we talk with love, and we always love each other when we see each other. A it's so good to hear. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B My grandmother was very positive. She has always been very encouraging and told me to continue my dreams and not let the little things drop me. So I'm happy to have it. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B usually, it's easy. Sometimes this is not the case. Can you tell me? B well, I was between the jobs recently. I'm starting a new job next week. But while I left, well, I didn't work. I tend to, as, my body wants to stand up later and later. And I try not to fall into the model to go to sleep at 2 or 3 years old and get up, like, 11. So I continue to try to sleep like midnight or 12:30 p.m., and I end up lying down for an hour or a half when I should be. I should be able to fall asleep and get up at 9 years old, but I always want to stand up, I suppose. A little dispersion like today, I am a little dispersed because I. I tried to fall asleep early and I ended up throwing and turning and therefore dispersed. How have you been feeling lately? B Well, since I had a lot of time on my hands, like, I generally do not have much time on my hands, so sometimes it can be frustrating because you don't know what to do with it when you don't work, I suppose. But yeah, I who answers the question. A good. Have you noticed changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B I just thought that I may be a little more absent than usual. Lately with the thing that does not work. A good. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B a few days ago, when I got my new job. When I was hired. A it's great. How does your best friend describe you? B Outting, listening, attentive. Amusing. Loyal. I think. I hope. I want me. I probably want me to look better. I would like to have more hair here. Lose a little. I would probably have liked to be a little meager. This belt is quite tight. And you know, sometimes I would have liked to have more money, but nothing too radical. I'm doing well. Yeah. A person made you feel really bad. B oh, when I was little, I was, I was it. I was the big kid. And my God, I remember that I said to myself, I was going to high school and it was like the second day. And I remember that this guy came to me and was like. He was pretty nice to me, I thought. And then I didn't know that he, like, it's like a film, right? Like, he had put aid to a group on his back that said like, I am a big cow. And said like, yes, like just a lot of nasty stuff. And I didn't know. And I walked with half an hour. I heard people laugh and I didn't understand it. And finally, this girl came to me and was like, hey, there are like group assistance on the back that sell these nasty things. And then she's just gone. She didn't like it, helps me remove them. And I remember like, I couldn't have it. I was trying to find it. And then I just remember putting my head in my locker and as, I didn't want anyone to cry. So, I just like to put my head in my locker and pretend as if I watched stuff in my backpack. But really I was, you know, the big kid who cries who could not remove the nasty stickers from his back. Yeah. Is there something you regret? B something? Uh, probably, yes. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B um, you know, I would. I would try to keep. I would try to let me know. Look at things positively and not, like, worry what others think of you. I think I spent too much time because, like a teenager, worried about what people thought of me. And when I get older, I didn't care so much and I started to enjoy life much more. SO. Tell me something you Recently that you really enjoyed. B I went to Coachella. It is a music festival. It was three days with all my friends and my boyfriend, and us. We danced and we went swimming and we did barbecue and we laughed and had a good time. A great. B yeah.

And my wife at the time, she wanted me to stop navigating and I got a regular job of 9 to 5 where I would have been very comfortable staying at sea and working on ships because I loved it.

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get me started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Quite well. I feel good. Los Angeles, California. Here. Mm. One of the few native born Los Angeles. A What do you do now? B I homeschool my 10 year old son and I'm a homemaker. I have five children and married 22 years. So that's a full time job, huh? A Do you travel a lot? B Somewhat. We went to Israel about two months ago for a pilgrimage with our church. Yeah. So I would say yes, I've traveled a bit. Well, most recently we like 2 months ago we went to Israel for a pilgrimage. We were gone about nine days and it was fabulous. It was. We spent the first five days in Khorazim, which is near the Galilee and in a place called. I mean, the name of the area is Chorazim. But we stayed in a place called the Dome of Scalilea, which is a house that welcomes Christian pilgrims as well as Jewish pilgrims. A That's so good to hear. What do you enjoy about traveling? B I enjoy, like really the most important thing I enjoy is like meeting the people and of course, seeing the history, especially Israel. I mean, it's totally ancient. But most I enjoy is the people. I think to get a better understanding of how different cultures live. A Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? B No, not at all. A Why? B Just don't I, you know, all my life I've always been open and. And willing to socialize. And I remember my younger brother always joking, saying that I would talk to anybody and I will, I'll talk to just about anybody just because I enjoy learning about other people. A What do you do to relax. B Most of the time? By the end of the day, after I've cooked dinner and we've had dinner together as A family. There's a word game on the computer that I like to play for a little while and then watch tv, have a cocktail with my husband and just relax. That's what we do. And you know, because we have a lot going on, we don't stay up too late. So I like to watch crime dramas. A Nice. What are some things that make you really mad? B Really mad? Probably not a lot I get frustrated with. For example, my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever. So that gets me angry. But in terms of like really getting like heatedly angry, I mean, other than like little things that my children do, you know, especially my oldest child who's 21, you know, he can be confrontational. So other than that, nothing really gets me like really angry. I haven't felt that. A What's the best thing about being a parent? B Contributing to society, helping to raise responsible people, I guess. And of course the love and the affection and the, the fun and the excitement that goes with it and all the stages that go. I mean like really right now I'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers. I only have, I have one 11 year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults. So it's really fun because we're able to talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know, have, have challenging discussions and that sort of thing. So it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and you know, changing diapers and that kind of stuff. The hardest thing is that it's 24 7, you're never not a parent, you know, and so you have to accept that. And that's. I remember when I first, with my first child, thinking when I brought him home from the hospital, this is it. I mean, there's no going back. You cannot change. I mean, I guess you could if you did something horrible, but I mean, under normal circumstances you can't change that. And it's a permanent thing and in some ways it takes away your freedom, but in other ways it gives you a different sort of freedom. A I see what you mean. There are always trade offs in life, aren't there? B Mm, always. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B I'm sorry, I didn't get what you said. Some of the things that have been a positive influence in my life, most importantly my church and my faith. But also my husband, he's been a really, he's kind of, he's very like logical thinking and very you know, grounded. So if I get emotional or I get upset about something, he's always. We balance each other out. Likewise, if he gets upset about something, I'm able to balance him out. So it's been a. That's been a great gift in my life. A How are you? B I don't. I don't think I'd be categorized as somebody with a temper. Occasionally I. Occasionally I get angry, but I don't, like, have, like, rarely do I have outbursts. I'm more. More likely to, you know, to say what I feel, not let it build up. So, you know, like, my husband and I don't rarely fight, like, have arguments that are, you know, yelling and screaming or anything like that. It almost never happens because, like I said, I'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot. So if I'm thinking something, I usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up. A That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Usually I'm arguing with my older son because he, you know, he thinks he knows everything. He's 21 years old, so he has the know it all mentality, and I'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all. And, you know, as life goes on, he'll learn more. And he's very confident and very self. What's the word? Self assured. And so he thinks that, you know, everything he does is correct, and he still has a lot of learning to do. That's all. A That sounds really hard. B Mm. It can be. Mm. A What do you think of today's kids? B I think that many of them are spoiled and live in an environment of instant gratification, which I think is going to be detrimental to the. To the future of this country. But given that with all the technology we have, there's really not any way to go back. So I have hope that they will. I mean, I think this country was built on hard work and ethics, and hopefully the next generation and the generations after that can maintain that standard of living. I don't know if it's possible. A How would your best friend describe you? B As loving, nurturing, funny. We laugh a lot. And caring, honest things that. I mean, my best. I have. Well, actually, my best friend is. It's two people. It's two sisters that I grew up with, and we. I, for some years, took care of their mother who has Alzheimer's, before my parents got sick. So I had a very close. Have a very close relationship with them. Still do. And so I'm considered the fourth sister. So I would say that those are my best friends and we love each other very much. It's a good relationship. A Have you ever served in the military? B No. A Have you ever been diagnosed with pts? B No. Yes, mostly minorly. Depression. It was more anxiety probably. It's probably been five or six years. I mean I've had it off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally like as a teenager I think is when I first started with the anxiety. But other than that I, you know, so depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control. But now it's under control. So I have a great. Huh. No, I think it was what they call free floating anxiety. More of organic reason for it. In other words that there was a chemical imbalance in my brain. I've been feeling pretty good actually. The holidays were great. We had a good family gatherings. A little stressed because we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out. My dad is really sick and we've offered to move in with them. They have a big home but we would have to do a lot of some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around. And so we're in the throes of that and so that's a big, big change. But I'm looking forward to it because really don't want my parents to be alone. As they get. They're in their 80s so as they get closer to death, I want to have my family there with. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Not easy usually. All my life, I think I've always, I mean I've always had. At least I wake up at least once in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom basically. And other than that, I mean, no, now I sleep well. I mean, other than that I sleep well. But sometimes if I wake up like really, really early in the morning, then I can't go back to sleep. I'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep. It depends on what my schedule is and if the kids have to be to school early and there's a lot of factors. Yeah, sometimes it does. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B Probably basically the same. I think I might complain a bit like, oh, I'm tired or my body hurts or whatever, you know. But I think overall I'm probably the same. My kids know. I'll tell my kids, oh, I'm really tired and they'll understand. Like my older daughter will be really helpful and maybe my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that. So, you know, they may pitch in a little bit more. A Have you noticed any changes in your. B Not really, no. Not really. Not anything significant, huh? Actually, yes, I do. I do feel like therapy is useful. Well, we had a situation with my daughter. She also suffers from anxiety and we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently we're about to finish a group with her. It was a six month group for dbt, it's called. And it's like a. It's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers. And it's been really good. It's been very, very helpful. It's just all about how to live in the moment and how to, you know, actual physical and mental strategies to keep your. Keep you from your mind from going crazy, you know, worrying about things or you know, in this case, some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever. So that's the focus of the therapy. And it's been really good. My husband and I both have been going with our daughter and it's been really, really informational and really helpful. I think that's so good to hear. Oh, my daughter was. She was in a bad way. She was, you know, suffering a lot and we knew it and we acted on it. That's all. A That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? B Like really joyful and happy? I would say probably. I mean probably it would be in Israel when we renewed our marriage vows in Cana. So you know, where the wedding of Cana took place. That was really moving and beautiful and it was, it happened that our anniversary was. We left on our anniversary day. We flew to Israel. So it was right at the same time. It was beautiful, very meaningful. And other than that, I would say, you know, like other joyful occasions have been, you know, like Christmas and you know, family gatherings and you know, my dad's birthday, he turned 83 Christmas Eve, you know, that kind of thing. That's an interesting question. I would say once I get like things done that I need to do, like if I'm have a lot of, a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run, once I get them done, I feel like a sense of accomplishment, you know, much like, I mean I worked for many years as an administrative manager at ucla and you know, once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or there's A lot of different things that you have to make deadlines. There's that feeling of like, yeah, I got it done, you know, So I think that would be, you know, for me, the most most recent way of feeling good and feeling, you know, like, feeling accomplished. A What's your dream job? B Dream job? I think I've already lived it. I'm also a birth doula and. Yeah. And so I've attended a lot of births and now I really only do it for family and friends. And it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is the birth, the bringing of new life into this world. So I would say that's probably was my. Was a dream job and I didn't know it. I trained much after, you know, I did my managerial stuff and it is and was awesome. So I don't work at a hospital anymore. Actually, the hospital that I worked at is now closed. But like I said, I do it for family and friends. I attended a friend of mine's birth by accident. She happened to have the same OB as I did with all my children. And I came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor. We were close friends. Her labor picked up quite a bit when I got there. She wanted me to stay, she didn't want me to leave. I hadn't planned on it. So that was the first birth that I attended outside of myself giving birth, which is a whole different experience. So after that I was really interested in possibly studying nurse midwifery. But then, then I discovered this thing called vingadula, which really gives you even a lot more hands on, one. On one contact with the patient, which is what I like. So I trained to do that at a hospital in Inglewood about 15 years ago because my son is 15 and he was a year old. No, 16 years ago. So. Yeah. And I've been. A How hard is that? B Well, it can be challenging in terms of hours. It depends on how long the woman's in labor. And you know, also, like, for me, I always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula, that I cannot guarantee 100% I'm not doing it for business. And that way. And because of that, I don't have like backup doulas that in case I'm sick or I'm not available, somebody else could fill in for me. So. But so far it's been that all the women that have asked me, I've been able to be there for some reason. So the, the. The only one that I missed Was one a friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby. I was with her for her first, but her labor went so fast, she didn't even call me. It was in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of labor. She would. Even if she had called me, I would have been there in time. So went really fast. But other than that, you know. Yeah, I've been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do. In all of life or in your job, probably my own birth. I mean, the birth of my own children. A How did you feel in that moment? B Like, there's an extreme sense of joy, excitement, relief, because of course, you're out of the pain. And then, like, it's just a matter of, you know, going forward from there. But it's like something you can't explain. It's just. It's awesome after you give birth. And I've experienced both ways. I've done both natural. And my last trial was by a C section, so I've had both experiences with my third child. I had kind of a crazy nurse. She was a little psychotic, but other than that. We laugh about it now, but when I was in labor, it wasn't funny. And she. She was not there when the doctor. I mean, my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water and woof. My husband was there, but she was not, nor was the doctor. And she got in a lot of trouble because I only had like two contractions after that and my daughter was born in the bed. So for me, it was great because I didn't have to go through any other labor. But I'm sure they weren't happy. They have to fill out a lot of paperwork after that. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. B Now? Would I give myself for 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago, I was probably more. Not as relaxed, not as. Like, I feel now at my age that I don't have the same concerns that I did then. I don't worry about. I don't worry at all about what people think about me. I don't worry at all about what, you know, like, I noticed my daughters, oh, mom, you can't wear that. Because people. People are going to say this. I say I don't care, but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that, oh, mom, you have to dress like this or dress like that or whatever. So that would probably be it, the wisdom that you achieve with age that you see how life. There's so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things. A What are you most proud of in your money? B Most proud of? Probably my family, my husband and my children. I mean, the fact that we've stayed married, that we're an intact family, that my kids see every day how their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents, and they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still, you know, we are still a family. So I would say that's probably it. Probably the. One of my best qualities is being able to listen to people and being able to not be judgmental. Through the years, I've had a lot of experience with people with problems, a lot of friends with problems, people that I know from church. And it's just taught me that everybody has weaknesses, everybody has problems, and I don't think I'm better than someone else. If you think you're better than someone else, then that's usually true me. A sign that you don't know yourself well enough. Okay. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. B Okay. A Goodbye. B Goodbye.

B Correct this just for this is not the case. Sorry. Okay, great. Just one last thing and then I'm going. Perfect. Okay, so again, she will let you know when she has finished. I'm going to give you the doorbell, but I will try to keep an eye on time too. A good, thank you. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming. Come today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? A yes. B So how are you today? A I am fine. I am a little thoughtful, I suppose, a little at the bottom, but more or less well. B I'm sorry to hear that. Where do you come from? R I was born in Annapolis, Maryland, on the East Coast. Why did you move to the origin? I moved because I went to the film school. But I decided to come. I returned to Washington D.C. to do work and now I'm back here. B How easy for you to get used to living in it? R it's very different to be from the east coast. He just has a different feeling. But living is very. Has a very different attitude, I suppose. And so it's a bit difficult, but me. But I have been more used to it since I was here. B How often do you return to your hometown? One step at all. When I left, things got it. Things were sort of. I. I lost my job there and therefore had to move here in a way quickly. To be with people who were going to help me. And I'm just in a way. I don't know if far away is the right word, but I'm not really talking about my family or my old friends. B How difficult is it? It is not easy. It's a bit. I miss a lot of people. I miss my old life before I lose my job. I miss friends. A lot of relationships I had there. So it's difficult. I mean, it weighs a lot in my mind. I feel like I have failed and now I'm here and I can't get back on my feet. So it's difficult. B yeah. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? R depends on the situation. I think I am out when I am comfortable and that I am extremely out. But when I am in a situation with which I am not comfortable, I tend to be much more shy. So that doesn't really answer your question , but. B ok. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? A I have sure. I do a lot of writing. I have a certain music that I listen to while I write and when I can really get there and somehow exclude the rest of the world, the music and the thoughts that happen, really, it makes me. It is as if I feel the most relaxed, I suppose. B when will it go back the last time it happened? A few weeks ago, I guess. I was working on a book on a novel. And when I was really. When I really started writing and it really worked for me, it was good. It was really good. I felt like I was doing something and I really felt relaxed. B what was it? R it was a guy who was looking for something. It is his last day on earth and he will therefore find a person he met and was so struck by that he needs to find her and spend the last minutes he has on earth with her just because a kind of A. It's a kind of romantic adventure comedy. B What has decided to do this? A well, I always have. I have always been a writer. Part of the reason I came to Los Angeles was because of the scenario. So I wrote some scripts and, you know, I had a little success with that here and. But since then, I have sort of arrived. I got tired of the limits of scripting and started writing more short stories and a longer creative writing. So I wanted to write a novel, but I was just waiting for the idea to really hit me. B How difficult is it? It is not easy. The pieces when it's good, it's really good. But getting there is sometimes a real struggle. I find it difficult. I have a real love hate relationship with writing. When I love it, I absolutely love it. But sometimes I hate it because it is so difficult. But it is worth it for the moments when it is good. B I see what you mean. How are you going to control your temperament? A good. I don't really have a temperament. This is not the case. I mean, most of my anger that I have been directed inward as opposed to the outside of other people. If something is really, really stressful or if I am in a situation like a very intense confrontation, I can lose it. But it probably only happened to me three, four times in all my life. I mean, generally I try roughly. When I am upset, I get angry with myself, not with other people. B when when you go back the last time you argued with Anyone and what was it? One last night? I guess I argued if cleaning of vegetables was necessary or not because of. I forget. Well, no, it was a question of knowing if you could clean the vegetables after cutting them because I had already started to cut the vegetables and I thought it would be good. It was therefore transformed into this great argument and we did research on Google to understand who was right and who was wrong and I ended up being wrong on that one. But it's. Yeah it was. It was not an argument of blowing, but it was a final argument. B ok. What do you feel guilty? A lot? Such. I was in a relationship that I really am, really. That I really wanted to work and I found myself. And it was partly due to. I didn't have it. I was not on the right medication. And so I went like everything that has become out of control and I really feel guilty of the way it ended. I mean, I was not. I was not mean, but I was. But I became more and more meat and I couldn't stop it and that. And so I really feel guilty not to do enough and make it say that she never wanted to see me again. So it was quite difficult. B could you have done something to avoid it? A well, part was that I was not properly medicated. I mean, now I went to a doctor and I am on medication that is completely a little. I mean, I am always upset and I am still depressed, but it is not as if it was. I don't lose it completely for days at a time. So I mean, I know that there is a part of me who logically knows that it was not my fault and that if I had done it, if I had been able to face the chemicals in my brain, I would have done it. Then it would probably have been different. If I were who I am now, then I would have. I would be, I would be. I would be. It would probably have disappeared very differently or maybe it wouldn't have done it, but I mean, I could have. I don't know. I don't know if I could have done something different, things being as they were. B do you think you may be a little hard with yourself? R I mean, it is possible. I mean, of course, yes. Because, I mean, that's what I do. I. I take little. I mean, I take little things, and I just think of them all the time in my head until it drives me crazy. I dwell on stuff, and it's like very small detail that presents itself, I suddenly remember, and it can simply discourage me for a whole day. I mean, I always become really uncomfortable and embarrassed, and I am ashamed of things that I did in high scho OL, which was years and years ago, what I should not even think about because it is so in the past. But I always have this feeling that I was there. B Yeah, it sounds really difficult. A well is not easy. I tried to find ways to face it. I mean, I take care of it for a long time by drinking and, you know, trying, as, slowing down my mind in this way. But, you know, from the drug, it has been better. It was not impossible to manage. It was not easy, but it is. But it was better. B is good. How to face it? A well, as I said, I do a lot. You know, if I write or if I do something, like, I must almost do two things at a time to completely occupy my brain. If I watch television, I have to play a game on my phone. If I use the computer, I have to watch a television show or a film in another window so that I can keep my mind busy during all this. I just need. I mean, I want I can just let thoughts come and face them, but I'm just. I can't yet. Are B triggered by something? A they are triggered by everything. About everything I see. If I hear someone with a Dutch surname, if I hear someone talking about Wisconsin, if I hear, you know, people talk about anything, you know, I can go up and connect to that. It's really. It's really. I don't know. It's the thing. I mean, I never have a break. B It sucks. One yeah. B How easy for you to have a good night's sleep? A I am a very light sleeper, so I am awake and asleep and awake, and I have no problem falling asleep. But in general, you know, don't do it. I don't know. I never really needed a lot of sleep, so it's just recently that I really started to feel the effects of not sleeping enough. I generally stayed standing up to 2 or 3 in the morning so that I could be so exhausted that I would simply make sure and wake up the next day and feel good, go to work. But now it's like I was doing this, I still don't sleep enough. I do not explain. I always sleep very slightly. I get up, I throw and turn all night, you know. And now it's right, it's. Yeah, I'm not sleeping too well at the moment. B How are you when you don't sleep? GOOD. A pretty. I mean, I don't know, it's difficult to do. It's hard to know. I. I am generally just in a way the power and just. I'm like how I'm now. I'm just, I just feel bad. B ok. How long have you been diagnosed for? A UM, I think three, four years ago. It was when I had been taking things for anxiety for years before. But then I finally had a psychiatrist who sat and told me about and told me: you actually have this situation. We have to get you up. The medication you don't work on. You have to take this new medication that will actually start to love yourself and heal you a little of all that. So, yes, it was a kind of turning point, but unfortunately, it happened after everything went wrong. SO. B I don't know. How did you feel at that time? See you in the moment? I don't know. I don't really think I thought about it too much. But looking back, I think it really makes me angry. It really does me, you know, given where I'm right now, it really makes me angry that I am. That I had. That I lost everything because of the chemicals in my brain, because of the things that I could not control and that, you know, the people who were supposed to help me do not help me. I mean, I paid, I paid a lot of money, to go see doctors and they were doing, they, you know, that was not the case, that did not help. It didn't work until, until you know, I managed to find someone who worked and I. Yeah. So I am. I'm like, thank you guys for helping. But it was a bit, it's a bit late now. B What made you ask for help? A There was really no choice. I had to. I was in disorder. It was either that I was doing self-drug, it affected my work. I mean, it was. Everything was right. There was a time when I really realized that, I mean, I just had to like to do this different. But again, it was too late because, you know, then my opinion appeared a few months later and you know, after, after all, after being institutionalized once or twice and all that, you know, they just decided that I was not worth staying. So they put me. But that was at least that and not to get me out, but yes. So I got help, but it was not early enough. B ok. Are you still in therapy now? Not as much as I should. I go to a few meetings. I go to AA so that I can keep control of this aspect. And there is a therapeutic aspect to that. Unfortunately, being unemployed, my unemployment has exhausted. I receive my drugs from the city of Los Angeles. So you know, I'm not really able to put money to see someone. So I have a psychiatrist that I will see, but it's really very. I only saw it three times in the past year. So it is essentially to Keep my medicines to come. B ok. A and then there is you. Yeah, it's true. B What kind of changes have you noticed since you have been in therapy? A well, as I said, I mean, just the speech. I mean, let's just take AA for example, because it is probably the closest that I see with the therapy at the moment. The simple fact of saying things aloud is like getting these things out. Trying to understand how to take this mess that is in your stomach and in your brain and making it words and sentences that make sense that you can really face is a big step, no matter what you say, whether it is a therapist or simply a piece full of, of tablecloths. You know, I mean, you take everything that has really killed you and you do something that you can manage, something you can write, something you can talk about rather than letting it sit there like this thing without form. Okay, yes. B How have you been feeling lately? R You know, better than I, that I have been it. I mean, it is sort of, he has his ups and downs. You know, I apply for jobs, five, six or more jobs per day, you know, and I never get an answer, without ever getting an interview, never getting closer to being again self-sufficient. It's hard. But it's like real problems. I have the impression that the chemical parts take control, as depression takes control. So now, that's right. I have to face real life, which is its own challenge. B Yes, it can be difficult to find a good job these days. One yeah. B tell me about the last time you felt really happy. R It was probably, you know, a few years ago. I was. I mean, the thing that immediately comes to mind is that everything was fine at work. I made these superb videos with this person with whom I. And we were very close. We had fun together. And we came out and obtained a Christmas tree, and we spent all this time choosing the perfect Christmas tree. And it was just like a part of someone's life and feeling like some of the biggest. The biggest life that is there. You know, like what normal people feel. You know, for this moment, I felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl whom he really liked a lot. And, you know, everything was fine. And I mean, it was not going very well because everything was messed up. But for this moment, I felt like a normal person, normal happy happy there. And part of what makes him so difficult now is to know that I don't know if I will never feel that. SO. B What are you the most proud in your life? One probably. Probably this educational series, I made a series of educational videos that I made for the National Science Foundation. It was really difficult, but in the end, it turned out to be really good. And I hope that it helps a lot of children and that it helps the world to excite children for science and. And on the world around him. So I have the impression that it was a real contribution that I made to the world. B It seems interesting. How did you decided to do this? It was part of, you know, that was part of my work. It was one. We were trying to find. With new ideas for. Because we would write videos and things to give, you know, schools and everything. And they had done it before, but we decided to do something really big, you know, and there were a lot of trips and there were many. And there were many. And so it was probably the biggest project that the NSF had decided to do. And so we just have kind. The kind of product. It's not really. Yeah. B tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. R I suppose. I don't know. I don't know. It's been a while since I didn't. Since I really thought about it. I don't know. Would I go somewhere? I. I don't know. B ok. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. A thank you.

"A good. B perfect. She will ask you a few questions. Questions. A good. All right. B Your answers are completely. Do you agree with that? A yes. All right. You. Englewood, California? Yeah, no, it's okay. Do you mean my girlfriend and my daughter? Yes. Are they doing well? It's good. It's cool. Yes I do it. Well, I am a football recruiter, so I travel around the world to sign different football players for our sports management company. Just independence on this subject. Being alone, being able to be free and not linked to one to one thing, you know is great. I remember having traveled and taking them to clubs and this and that. And we are not this type of organization. Dishonesty. I don't like it when people are dishonest. It really bothers me, really, really. And not true, not honest, not real. It upsets me a lot. I tend to try to free myself from the situation, to empty my mind. Usually make a walk or something like that, or just go to the room by myself and just try to empty my head. I sometimes agree with that, but I can certainly be better. Oh, I argued with my. My wife a few days ago, and it was our daughter and some of the things she does in school. And she wants to raise her in a sense and I think I want to raise her kind in a different way and discipline her a little more on certain situations. So I think that discipline is a big key in the life of a child, and it was raised a little differently. I don't know. Just angry, upset. You know, when you are in an argument, that's what you feel. So you do and say things that bother you and you just. You continue. Yeah, a bit. I don't know. I'm coming. The way I feel. I don't know. I can't really say as I feel a little. A little. I don't know. Just reality, honesty, truth. Be fair directly in front. B How far are you from your family? A I am quite close. I am quite close to my family. Oh. On the YouT on the YouT. Just. They are raised different. I think society will become even wilder. The way children are raised and no discipline and the things they do, everything in which they live, everything is so swollen where it comes to a point where it becomes uncontrollable. I think children these days to a certain extent are much wilder than me and generations before me and just able to do and say. And the lack of respect and, you know, just in terms of education, is fair. I think it's just difficult. Difficult times for children and the way they act. It's ridiculous for me. I really like to look at sport . I like to play. I like to travel. I like to skate. I like a bit like a guy who likes to see different sites and go different places. I am a large person of cinema, so I like to go to theaters, things like that. I live it. I always wanted to be in a kind of sports industry, and that's what I'm doing now. I'm coming. My goal is to become a little higher in a scale and have my own sports management company. But I'm doing well enough for me, so I'm happy. Yeah. No, no. B How easy for you to have a good night's sleep? A it's good. It's quite easy. Irritated? Fatigue? I don't know. It's been a while. It's been a while. A few weeks ago. Eh. What did you say? No, not really. I think he would describe me like a standing guy. I try to be a good faithful friend and an adult. I think you would describe me like that. School. Went to school. Grew up together. I have known all my friends for almost all my life. Yeah. Very close man. My friends and I are very close. We do just about a lot at this age. I am honest. I am faithful, very faithful. I am a hard worker. I think I am to some extent. I'm just not the average guy. I'm about. I am another. Different breed. I just wear myself and I act a little different from a normal guy. I don't know, just how I was raised and how my father was a little different, and he did not go with it. In the crowd. And I think I learned a lot from him. And. And that's right. It is in a way the same path that I took. Yeah. Many things I regret. I regret a lot of decisions in my life. B Can you give me an example? One yeah. 1. In fact, I left a lady of my life years ago that I thought I was my soul mate. And we had a big argument, and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break. And this break, I started to go out with someone else. And I told her I'm going to go in my way, and she goes in her direction. I think it was a big one. A bad decision. Very bad decision. Yeah, totally. I think I could have taken a step back and really think a little more about the situation instead of being so upset and going ahead. Just upset. I tend to get upset, then my thoughts are troubled. So I need to think a little more when I am upset. I don't know. I feel time, to compensate for your mistakes and to be better on different decisions. After making mistakes, think a little about the situation, situations and things. And the decisions you make, think much longer and more before taking them . And I think the result would be a little different today. My grandmother, she has always been a positive influence. She is a big black woman with lifestyles of the old school. So I think I added this to my life. She is a great woman and a baseball and yes, I was a very good player. I was a very good athlete growing up. I was one of the best. And it started a future in athletics, and that's what I wanted to do. So I reached my goals. So, at the time, it was a good thing and it is always a good thing. It is a great accomplishment in my life. B What are the things that usually. A realization. Power. If I have a goal or something that I am supposed to do this week or that day and that I accomplish, it always puts me in a good mood or does my job, and the way I am supposed to do it in a timely manner, it always puts me in a good mold. Being a positive model at the moment for young children is in our Sports Academy program. I think that by age, the process of reflection and the way I look at life have completely changed. And I think that many children can look at me with whom I take care of now and say, you know, it is someone who is a positive influence in my life. Oh, a few days ago, my football team was in the playoffs, made the playoffs. So it always makes me happy. THANKS. THANKS. Bye. Bye.

"A thank you. Okay, great. B Very good. Wonderful. Okay, thank you. A hi. Hi. I am Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yeah. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. A it's good. Where do you come from? B I come from Los Angeles. A really? B mm. What are the things you really like at? B oh, time. Time, time, time. The beach. Time, the beach. Relaxed ventilation, driving instead of public transport and sportsman. I'm really. I don't know. The lack of. I don't know. There is not much that I do not like in relation to most cities. I'm really. He's my favorite. And I lived all over the world. I love him. I love it a lot. A it's great. I'm sure you can say it by these shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. B yes. I lived in Paris and I am a lot in the world. A great. What do you like on travel? B that's right. It's fun and it's an explosion. It's good to see new places. It is good to discover all the fantastic sites and. And cultures. To I would love to hear about one of your trips. B well, I mean, I tended to do a lot. I would probably do them differently. I think I'm more developed as a person now. I lived in Paris for two years and lived in Spain. Spain was fun. Madrid is a party city. And then. And then. So it was all work. They all worked. So I worked. So it was a version. And you didn't really appreciate it, you know, which surrounds you so much. And then, I mean, I'm still. I love going just for, you know, vacation places like Hawaii and Jamaica. I'm always really a suction cup for this kind of thing. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B I guess Madagascar was more or less, as, really moaning because it was in the 80s and it was as if you saw a lot of people who had never seen whites before, according to the guy who was driving us. He could have lied, but it was right. It was groans. Africa was almost the best. Senegal and Madagascar. Yeah. A beautiful. What have you studied at school? B I'm currently on the verge of going for an early childhood education diploma. And then I did a little parajurist, but it was really fair has. Just to get the allowance. I really had no concept of what I wanted to do, and now I really do it. What decided you to do this? B I. I said to Rachel, in fact, I don't know if you could do it here. I really think that the way the school system is going on right now, it is transforming people into a dog just eating a dog. I don't like the way. I think it is the soul that empties the school system at the moment. And I feel pretty bad for everyone. So I want to try to solve this problem. What is your dream work? B It would be my dream work. So I'm excited that, like, I want to go in a direction in which I want to go. Yeah, that would be the case. My dream work is to work with a kind of children in a more organic, universal trajectory, you know. How difficult? B I think it could be done. I don't think it would be done via a kind of legislation except here and there. I mean, it always ends up becoming, you know, the facade and the farce itself anyway. But I think there are means. I have always reached children anyway, and they always felt where I came from. And so I think, you know, there are ways to make a kind of system oral without even talking to the system. A good. Do you consider yourself less shy or out? B I guess I'm just a combination of the two. I don't think. I don't know. Actually. I'm a bit. I could even work this. There could be a certain outing to overcompensate what is really shyness and vice versa. So you don't know? Yeah, yeah. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. B Yeah, it's cool. What are you doing to relax? B I certainly try to think and stay in a fairly lucid space as often as possible. So a lot of sleeping at the moment. I'm in transition, so there are just a lot. And I hang out a lot with my dogs, so it's quite soothing. I try not to do. I do not really do anything too tense unless it is time for that, like the time to lead to a job or time for, you know, that certain things happen, meetings and stuff. But otherwise I try to stay in a fairly relaxed space most of the time. It is therefore not like a break and. But you know, and I miss swimming. I cannot believe that summer is coming, so I'm also going to swim a little more. How are you going to control your temperament? B When I'm really indignant, it comes out. And then I’m hitting a kind of bad parts right now because it’s a very difficult time. I fight for my child. So there are times when I go St Cuss has a storm just to get down from the steam. Did that cause you to trouble? B a little, but generally roughly. There is always, you know, someone on the outskirts that gets it and, you know, it's like this bumper sticker. If you are not indignant, you are not careful. Thus, a kind of mental health can therefore prevail. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone? Well, well, I mean, these are also times when I can't find something in the car. But when I chat with people, it was most of the time I am flat, you know, sabotaged or definitely when. What is the last time precise? Well, me, you know, I lost my temperament with terrible with, unfortunately, the woman who gave me birth because that. She is intrinsic in many. I mean, she is an almost horrible person. So I recently lost my cool with her. How did you feel at that time? B I felt like. I mean, I, like, again, I think I have somehow said it earlier. I felt, in a way, well, because I understand, you know, what is. Instead of not obtaining it, which is even worse. But I suppose there is another side of the bank of the thing to reach, where you can be a little more constructive on this subject. It's like, you know, you arrive at a point where you are happy that you can really see that there is a horrible parody, but you must then find how to manage the horrible parody. But. So, I mean, I didn't feel, shame. Honestly, I had no shame. I didn't do it. I didn't feel. There are times when I feel like it was stupid to lose my composure just because there are people who will try to use it against you. That's it. But I never really feel bad to be angry with what I'm angry with. A good, tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B Well, when I was pregnant, I would have liked to have. As I said, I went through such a awakening to realize when I was somehow undermined, that the requirement of my respect has become a huge problem. And when I was pregnant, I ended up being so missed in the place because I was a hippie on the beach for six years. So I had the impression of being so disrespectful in the place where I had to be when the child arrived that I made a storm by what was a good mode of survival before, but let me jump from the pan in the fire and they had my child, then. A wow. B Yeah, it sounds really difficult. It's screwed up, I know. A Tell Me on an event or something you want you to erase from your self Mory. B I don't want to erase anything from my memory. I like everything to be consolidated and coherent and integrated. I don't want to erase anything from my memory. A good. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to make. B Well, I understood well or did I hurt? Yes, I suppose that the most difficult decision was whether or not it should sign a mediation agreement with DCFS. And I should have said, no, let's just go directly to court, because there is nothing wrong with me. I just succumbed to a SSI check via bullshit with my mother, and I should have been, you know, courageous enough to go and do this. And instead, I got out and I made their mediation and they played me. What decided you to do this? B on caution. A good. Tell me about your relationship. B It's horrible, horrible, the quality of Borgia, the intrigue and the sabotage. It's bad. It's good. Someone who, I mean, there was, you know, there have been. Great people again from afar. I did not really achieve a very great ability to establish relationships. And I work through this right. Right away. And I think it's a lot. Why I don't have my son. But as I grew up and I developed, I saw encouragement in similar souls. And you can see it. And so it's wonderful. But if not, you know, a constant, you know, contact with someone who is really good for me. It was difficult for me to get to this point. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B not so easy these days at all. Why am I, I was it. I am not completely centered. And then there have been real people, you know, people thinking it's funny to harass me or shatter when they pass. And so there was real harassment and things like that. How are you when you don't sleep? GOOD. B I'm still quite Pollyanna Ed, I'm still in advance and I try to be as pleasant as possible. How have you been feeling lately? B I am tired and exhausted and a little frustrated because I know I was in a way. Did I have some sort of energy and usurped space and I can say it. And I don't know how to go through it and overcome it. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B there is. I am fundamentally a very, very, very happy and almost happy. But these fights for my son made me somehow areas that are somehow. It is as if the same trees that were Throwing on my way in childhood before realizing that I was such a happy person threw again. So I cross some of the same traps and errors. But, you know, during the day, I'm going. I'm going to think of something completely true and organic and I'm just going to look at something and go, wow, it's beautiful. And I will remember that I am quite close to my mind. So I try to stay there 24 7. I am quite spiritual in this way. How would your best friend describe you? B I mean, if I had one who was ready to say all the beautiful things about me. Becomes quite competitive there, you know, that I am. It's out of you guys. That I'm funny and that. And that I think it's bad. That I am funny and that I am well and that I am trustworthy. What are the things you want to change about you? B Just I. does not necessarily change, but grow thanks to my ability to connect with the people with whom I want to connect and disconnect people who have managed to empty me. I have already said that I regret the thing by leaving the place where I could have delivered my son, even if I was somehow abused. A right. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B get away from your mother. Sorry. You know, and like many. And yes. And to open your eyes. Watch what. Look at what's going on. A good. What are you most proud of in your life? B I am proud of my mind and my perspectives and mine. My access to what is really going on in the world and my mating. I'm just proud of myself as a person. A it's great. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. B ok. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. B nothing. A bye. B bye. Directly on. It was detached. All right. Is that the old thing?

"A Okay. Okay. So she's going to ask you some questions once I leave the room. And then when she's done, she's going to say goodbye. And then you're going to press this button to let me know you guys are done. B Okay. A All right, thanks. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So, how are you doing today? B Good, thank you. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B El Segundo, right down the street. A Really? What are some things you really like about la? B The beach. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B The smog. A I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B I try to, when I have time. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Being away from home. Getting away. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B I recently went to Palm Springs with my wife and my friends and it was really nice. It was 100 degrees outside and we lay by the pool and barbecued. A Nice. What's one of your most memorable experiences? B I'm not sure. Probably graduating from college. Maybe. A Can you tell me about that? B I was the first person in my family to graduate, I guess from college. So it was kind of a big deal. A That's great. What did you study at school? B Advertising, communications and public relations. A That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? B Well, in junior college I did communications, a lot of public speaking classes. So I went on and transferred to a university and wanted to study the same thing, I guess. A Are you still working in that? B Yeah, I work in advertising now. A What's your dream job? B Dream job? Probably to. To work for a big golf company and do their advertising for them. A Awesome. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I'm definitely not shy. Maybe might seem like it right now just because I'm not. This is a different. A new setting. But usually outgoing. A I understand. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I like to go to the gym, I think. I like to run and be outdoors. I surf a Lot. So anytime I'm stressed, I definitely just try to go to the gym or wake up earlier and surf before work. A How are you? B I don't really have a temper. I just. I'm pretty mellow. A That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Haven't really argued with anyone. We have disagreements, you know, with family members or friends, but it's usually solved right then and there. A Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Mmm, I'm not sure. A What's something you feel guilty about? B Maybe not providing for my family as much as I'd like to, I. I guess. A Okay, tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B I'm not sure off the top of my head. A Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B It's pretty good. We're all pretty close. Dad, mom, sisters, brothers, wife in laws. Siblings? Yeah, everyone pets. A That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Probably my dad. He's a hard worker and he's kind of trained me to do the same thing, be the same way. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B That's one thing I struggle with. I definitely get a good night's sleep, but it's hard to go to sleep just over the years of sleep deprived insomnia. A little bit of insomnia. I mean, it's getting better now that I'm getting older. I'm training my body to go to bed around 1, but when I was younger it was 2, 3, 4 in the morning. A How have you been feeling lately? How have you been feeling lately? B I feel okay. Happy. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B I mean, a little bit right now just because my wife is pregnant. So I'm slowly feeling a little bit of the side effects, I guess. A Can you tell me about that? B Yeah, I mean, I feel a little. A little down here and there, but at the same time I'd. Like I said I just go to the gym or go for a longer run, you know, because she's healthy, we're healthy, you know, everything's good and all that, but supposedly you get the man pregnancy side effects. It's our first, so I'm unfamiliar with the feelings. A I see what you mean. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B This morning when I went, I woke up. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Have not. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B I got to get together with a couple of my friends and play a round of golf. Enjoy the sunshine. Nice day. A Cool. How would your best friend describe you? B As outgoing and hard working and a good family person. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Maybe just to have a little bit more confidence. Yeah. A Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. B I don't recall. A Okay. Is there anything you regret? B Not really. I try not to have any regrets. Just move forward from something negative, I guess. Just try to move on. And. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B To go to school, stay in school, invest early, start a 401k early. All the things you know, start a retirement fund, all the above. A What are you most proud of in your life? B Just being raised by a good family and training myself to be a hard worker and hard enough worker to provide for my family and hopefully be successful one day. And CEO of my company. Right now I'm, you know, at the bottom of my advertising agency. But continue to work harder and move up. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.

"A perfect. It looks good. Also start this recording. Okay, great. So put the doorbell here and you can just leave me. B Okay, thank you. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answer is completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B ok. A it's good. Where are you from? B from Santa Monica. A really? What are the things you really like? B people, especially. What are the things you don't really like at it? B Well, people too. R I see what you mean. I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B No, not much. One why? B well, I cannot afford to travel as much as I wish. A good. What are you studying at school? B I was a major in English. Who seems interesting. How did you decided to do this? B I just liked to read a lot at the time, so it sounded like the best thing. Well, the most fun thing to study. Have you always done that? B no, more more. A like my work. You could almost say that it is practically made for me. What is your dream work? B I guess my dream work would be to manage a football club. How difficult? B oh, it would be almost impossible for me. One why? B I have no experience in this area. R I understand. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B very shy. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I play music. What are you doing when you are annoyed? B What should I do when I'm annoyed? I don't know. What should I do when I'm bored? I can't think of anything. I don't know. I don't think. Yeah, I don't do anything specifically. How are you trusting? Check your temperament? B pretty well. I would say very well. I don't get my cool very often. A it's good. When will you go back the last time you argued with someone? And what was it? B when when I went back the last time I argued with someone? I don't remember. Yeah, I don't have many conflicts with people. I don't remember the last time I argued with someone. In Tell Me on an event or something you want to be able to erase from your memory? B Well, let's see. When I was little, I was outside my grandfather Restaurant Arent and there was a flight and I saw it. Well, I saw it when the thieves left. Yeah. Maybe I would like to erase this from my memory if I could. How did you feel at that time? B well, I didn't know what was going on at that time. So I didn't feel so bad at the time, but I felt bad after because then you know, my mother was upset. My mother was there and she had to call the police and it was. It was disturbing to see her, you know, really disturbed that way. But when it happened, I was not really upset. It was more the consequences. Real, it sounds really difficult. B What about a situation you want. Have you manipulated differently? B A situation that I do not know. Well, I can think. There are probably a million situations that I would have liked to manage differently. I can't think of one in particular. Maybe I think when I was a child. Well, I think when I was. Let's see. Oh, I have. Okay, I have a good one. I did not marry the girl I think I should have married. It is therefore a big for me. Can you tell me? B yeah. Well, we were together for about four years and I think I just kept it for acquired and I did not hire it. And it was a long time ago. And now that it's been so many years, I realize. Well, I don't know if it is a realization, but I now think that yes, she should have been my wife, that we were intended for each other or that we were made for each other. But because my selfishness and because I just had this fear of commitment at the time, I just felt that I did not do it. I did not do what I should have done, what the intelligent thing would have been. R which you feel guilty? B well, the last thing I can think that I would say that I feel guilty was, you know, I feel a lot of guilt about my friendships. I don't feel like I’m as good friends as possible. But at the same time, I don't really know exactly how I could be a best friend. I just feel a little guilty that I am not. I can't help people. Anyone who has a problem, I can't. I never feel like I can help someone I know who has a problem. R when is the last time that happened? B that occurs every day. I guess it happens with all those I know and everyone. All my loved ones and all my friends. I don't feel like I can really give them anything or help them in their lives. A Tell Me on your relationship with your family. B well, it's very distant. It's fair. It's very Cordial and that's very. I don't know what the word is. It's on the. It is kept on a surface, I don't think. I don't think my family really knows me very well. And I don't know them very well either. Not in a real sense. So, yes, I think that many families are so. But it bothers me that mine is like that. One yeah. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B oh, it's very easy. I sleep a lot and me. Yes, I have no problem sleeping. R Have you noticed these latest changes in your behavior or your thoughts? B no, not. Not really. I would say that I am now, it's the way I think I have been all my life. So, even when I was little, I slept a lot too. And no, I don't think I have changed much. How have you been feeling lately? B Pretty Down. But as I said, in a way that I could say, yes, I feel really depressed. But then again, I have always been like that, so it is difficult to say that it is down when it is always in this way. One yeah. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B yes. How long have you been diagnosed? B oh, a long time ago. I was about 10 years old or there. What made you ask for help? B I just missed a lot of school. I didn't want to go to school. So, finally, they sent me to a therapist and then to a psychologist then. And then to a psychiatrist, and it started from there. Are you going to always in therapy now? B No, I haven't been in therapy since I was a teenager. Why did you stop? B well, I didn't think it helped me at all. So, one day, I decided that I didn't want to go there anymore. How did a therapist affect you? B Well, as I said, I didn't think it had helped me. So I guess I don't know that it affected me a lot. Do you have any disturbing thoughts? B No, I wouldn't say disturbing, no. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B well, I feel pretty happy every time I see my nephew and I have the children of my best friend. I have the impression that they are my nephew and my niece and I am quite happy when I am around them. A it's great. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B My ideal weekend would be. I would probably travel. I would really like to get out of the city every weekend. Go anywhere, really. Anywhere outside the city. What do you like in travel? B just see how the different people live and how people are different wherever you go. I really think people are different when you go to different places and how they interact with you and how it See the world. Different food. And. I also like historic places. I am in history and me. And I just like to visit anywhere who has a kind of historical meaning. A great. I would love to hear about one of your trips. B I haven't made a trip for a long time. The last trip I really made was that I went to France a few years ago for a wedding, and I had a great time there. I had always wanted. I wanted to go to Paris, so I was able to go to Paris, then I went to a small town which is a few hours from Paris where the wedding was. And, yes, it was really fun. I think the church where marriage was in a thousand years. A wow. B Yeah, it was a really cool trip. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What. That would. Would it be considered memorable? To everything that comes to mind. B a memorable experience. The most memorable experience, I guess, would probably be nothing special, but to live with a girl that I told you earlier that I now think that we should have married is something that remains in my memory. This is why I say that it is memorable, because it is always with me, and it is something that I do not think, you know. Well, I know that I will never forget, but it's not a special day or a special moment, you know? One yeah. What are the things you want to change about you? B Well, a lot. I would like to be able to be healthier, of one thing, more energetic and more sympathetic. Well, I think I am quite nice, but more outgoing, more social. These two things. Above all, I guess I would like to be more social, more enthusiastic and more. And healthier. How would your best friend describe you? B This is a good question. My best friend. How would my best friend describe me? I think. I think he would say that I am very. Well, it sounds cheesy, but he would probably say that I am a very spiritual person and that I give very. I think I am much more selfish than people think, but people think that I am not selfish. And he probably would say that I am creative too. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Well, my advice to myself. I don't understand the question. Is there something you regret? B Yeah, but we have already talked about it, right? What are you most proud of in your life? B No, I can't. Well, I don't think I really think I am proud or proud. I don't think the achievements are really something he is proud of, drinking I can't really think about an achievement anyway. Even if I had something that I am proud of, I cannot think of anything, no kind of accomplishment I had. A good. Tell me about something you have done recently that you really enjoyed. B Something I recently did that I really enjoyed it? Well, I sang the karaoke with a few friends from my friends and I generally do not do that, but. Yes, it was very fun a few days ago. A fee. All right. I think I lost everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. B Thank you. A farewell. B It was more difficult than I thought. She just puzzled me a lot. Most of the time. And I was. I think I improved after a while. And I was. Yeah. At first, I thought, oh, they will go crazy because I say nothing and I don't know how to answer.

"A Okay. B Thanks, Rachel. A She says goodbye. Press this button, I'll come back in. B Thanks, Rachel. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you.

B I'm fine, thank you. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B New York City. A Really? B Yes. A When did you move to LA? B It's 1975. That's a long time. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B About once a year. A How does it compare to la? B Both urban, big cities, but east coast has a little bit, maybe a little more character, West Coast a little more weighed back. A Why did you move to la? B With family. Came with my family. I was young. A Okay. What are some things you really like about la? B I like the weather. I like. The women are beautiful, the culture is fantastic. The, you know, the city affords a lot of opportunities, employment wise, lots of, lots of good things. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B Traffic. People who only care about themselves. A I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B I can't see your shoes. I've traveled a bit. Europe and throughout the States. Yeah. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B The new experiences. It's always fun to travel, to get a break from where you are and have new experiences. And the great thing about it too is when you return home, it kind of helps you reset your. It kind of makes you appreciate coming home as well, you know, I've been to Spain and England and Italy. Different, different places. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Probably Barcelona. Loved Barcelona. The architecture and the. Well, food was a part of it, but just my experiences there were fantastic. A Awesome. What did you study at school? B Art history. A That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? B I was always good artistically, so it seemed natural. Probably should have studied graphic design, which I later got into. A What's your dream job? B To be the star of my own TV show. I would be the most hilarious comedian making the entire country laugh at my brilliant comedic point of view on life. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Outgoing. Always have been. As an actor, as a kind of a comedian? I do. I'm A comedian as well. And you have to be outgoing. It's more fun. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the festive guy. What do you do to relax? B Try to take a peaceful walk. Do yoga. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Much better. I used to be, I think, when I was younger. Not so good lately. I'm actually very proud of it. A That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B I think the only time I really argue is on the phone with Time Warner Cable. I know it's been a while. Maybe not working hard enough. Some days when you're a freelancer, it's hard to keep at yourself to consistently be productive. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Well, I don't know. Can we come back to that one? I can't think right now. A Tell me about the hardest decision. B Probably once, when I moved back to Los Angeles from Boston and I had a girlfriend at the time and it was hard to leave, I knew I had to come back. But I think it. That particular move west was. A What made. B You decide to do that. Felt it was calling me, and that's where my connections were, and I had to come home. A Are you happy you did that? B I think so, yes. A Okay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish. B Erase from my memory. I don't know. Gosh, I mean, I don't know. Something you feel guilty maybe. You know, maybe doing something when you're a little. You've had a couple of extra drinks and you made out with a girl that you shouldn't have. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B It's pretty good. I think they're a challenge. My folks are together. I got a sister. My sister's in New York. Not the tightest family, but, you know, I'm grateful for everything that I've derived from it. A Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B I have a best friend that I went to college with, and he's very smart. I consistently call him when I'm having challenges, life challenges. I will consistently call this. Well, a few specific friends to get advice. And I like that. I have a couple of friends who have been tremendously influential and supportive. Friends are good. Friends are very important. A Yeah. That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep. B Sometimes? Most of the time, not horrible, but not Amazing. I mean, it's okay. Dragging, not motivated or. Yeah. A How have you been feeling lately? B Pretty good. Pretty good. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts? B No. I mean, I think they're consistent with way I've been for a while. A Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B I think when I get consistent work, when I get a lot of. Do a lot of creative stuff, get a lot done creatively. A Best friend describe you. B I guess I would hope something like, you know, a charismatic, fun, loyal guy. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B I wish I were more aggressive, more consistent with pursuing dreams. I do a lot. I do enough. Sometimes I get down on myself for not trying harder to do all the artistic things I love to do. A I see. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. B Um. Well, recently. Recently I signaled into Elaine. This woman was shouting at me. I could hear it because our windows were open. It was a hot summer day. And then later I drove up beside her and I said in a pleasant way, I said I was just trying to signal to get into your lane. Because she was cursing at me through the window prior to that. And she just lifted up her finger and gave me the finger. And it was just. It's funny, sometimes you try to approach someone in just a normal, loving way and all they have for you is hate. And that did make me feel bad, a little angry. A That makes sense. Is there anything you regret? B No, because I took the high road. But she regrets, I'm sure. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Just go out with friends, make dinner. Recently a bunch of. I had a small party at my house and one guy cooked food and we had a bunch of friends over and that's always fun. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B See, never get too up or too down, too high. Don't accentuate the highs and lows because there's always a different. It's a endless roller coaster. So you need to be prepared for that long ride. A What are you most proud of in your life? B Creative things. The creative, the performances, the comedic performances, the commercials I've done, the acting, the stand up comedy, the graphic design, all my creative filmmaking, all my creative outlets that are an expression of me. A That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. B Bye. Bye. That was funny. There was the funniest point that just made me laugh was she goes, you can probably.",0,okay b thank rachel say goodby press button come back b thank rachel hi elli thank come today creat talk peopl safe secur environ therapist learn peopl would love learn ask question get us start pleas pleas feel free tell anyth answer total confidenti okay b ye okay today b fine thank good origin b new york citi realli b ye move la b long time often go back hometown b year compar la b urban big citi east coast littl bit mayb littl charact west coast littl weigh back move la b famili came famili young okay thing realli like la b like weather like women beauti cultur fantast know citi afford lot opportun employ wise lot lot good thing thing realli like la b traffic peopl care see mean sure tell shoe much world explor travel lot b ca see shoe travel bit europ throughout state yeah enjoy travel b new experi alway fun travel get break new experi great thing return home kind help reset kind make appreci come home well know spain england itali differ differ place one memor experi b probabl barcelona love barcelona architectur well food part experi fantast awesom studi school b art histori sound interest decid b alway good artist seem natur probabl studi graphic design later got dream job b star tv show would hilari comedian make entir countri laugh brilliant comed point view life consid shi outgo b outgo alway actor kind comedian comedian well outgo fun sometim feel tens turn fish tank screensav hey know hawaii festiv guy relax b tri take peac walk yoga control temper b much better use think younger good late actual proud good last time argu someon b think time realli argu phone time warner cabl know mayb work hard enough day freelanc hard keep consist product tell situat wish would handl differ b well know come back one ca think right tell hardest decis b probabl move back lo angel boston girlfriend time hard leav knew come back think particular move west made b decid felt call connect come home happi b think ye okay tell event someth wish b eras memori know gosh mean know someth feel guilti mayb know mayb someth littl coupl extra drink made girl tell relationship famili b pretti good think challeng folk togeth got sister sister new york tightest famili know grate everyth deriv okay someon posit influenc life b best friend went colleg smart consist call challeng life challeng consist call well specif friend get advic like coupl friend tremend influenti support friend good friend import yeah good hear easi get good night sleep b sometim time horribl amaz mean okay drag motiv yeah feel late b pretti good pretti good notic chang behavior thought b mean think consist way okay ever diagnos ptsd b diagnos depress b tell last time felt realli happi b think get consist work get lot lot creativ stuff get lot done creativ best friend describ b guess would hope someth like know charismat fun loyal guy thing wish could chang b wish aggress consist pursu dream lot enough sometim get tri harder artist thing love see tell time someon made feel realli badli b um well recent recent signal elain woman shout could hear window open hot summer day later drove besid said pleasant way said tri signal get lane curs window prior lift finger gave finger funni sometim tri approach someon normal love way hate make feel bad littl angri make sens anyth regret b took high road regret sure tell someth recent realli enjoy b go friend make dinner recent bunch small parti hous one guy cook food bunch friend alway fun advic would give 10 20 year ago b see never get high accentu high low alway differ endless roller coaster need prepar long ride proud life b creativ thing creativ perform comed perform commerci done act stand comedi graphic design creativ filmmak creativ outlet express great okay think ask everyth need thank share thought goodby b bye bye funni funniest point made laugh goe probabl

B and then I will tell you a little more about how she works afterwards. A good. B so I'm going to ring you here. When she finished, push this to let me know. A good, thank you. B Hi. A hi. B Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? Sure. B ok. So how are you today? A good. B is good. Where do you come from? One originally? Originally, I come from Korea. B really? When did you move to the? R when I was a year old. B You were very young, right? A yes. B How often do you return to your hometown? An almost never. I went to Korea once. B What are the things you really like at the? I like time and be near the ocean and culture has a lot to do. Food, there is a lot to love. B What are the things you don't really like at it? Has traffic. It seems that we have a lot of economic difficulties. And the parking tickets are super high. Sometimes I am really bored by our government. B I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. R do you travel a lot with your shoes? Have you said you bought your shoes? Your shoes cannot be manifested. I traveled a little. I am sort of traveled. I did not trace a little in a little while. B What do you have to travel? A OH, just that helps you keep things in perspective on our life here. It's exciting. Exciting. And it gives me the impression of really living. Because sometimes we are stuck in this bubble here in Los Angeles and seeing other places. You realize that, you know, life is a lot of different things that you do not think every day. B I would love to hear about one of your trips. A well, one of my trips, I went. I went to Singapore then to Thailand and it was when I was with my ex -boyfriend and we went to. He was a sales engineer or systems engineer, but he did that year. And so it was a bit like a business. So we went to Singapore for a few D Ays and it was really interesting. You know, of course, it's very different there. Not only like going to Canada or something like that, but they had a big reception in the evening that we got there and they had as a piece published by the directors of the company, which was really fun. And after Singapore, we did a few tours in Singapore. It was really. It was an interesting experience. It's really clean there and it's really. There are not many crimes, but the government is very. It's a bit imposing, but it was very interesting. Then we went to Thailand and it was almost. It was really completely different because it was like the jungle. We went to Phuket, this small island, and it was very primitive compared to Singapore, just in any different ways. It was very interesting and it was nice. Everything was really cheap. I had a massage on the beach for $ 8. It was interesting. Yeah, it was an hour for $ 8. B awesome. What have you studied at school? A well, I'm at school right now and I haven't finished school when I was younger because I had health problems. So I'm here. I'm just making my general Ed right now. I'm going to SMC. B it's great. A yeah, I am happy. B What is your dream work? A well, my dream work would be to be a veterinarian, but it is probably not very realistic for me at this stage of life. And also because, monetary, it is expensive, but it would be my dream work, working with animals on a veterinary basis. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? R I think I'm right on the point. It depends on the environment and the people with whom I am and how comfortable I am. But I'm really out when I feel comfortable with people. And I will really be reserved if I am not. B who makes sense. Yeah. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? A well, I mean, apart from sleeping, I like to relax things like doing a bike ride on the strand, or if I am at home just, like reading or sometimes I can just go to bed and my mind could do things, but I'm a little relaxing. B How are you going to control your temperament? A really good step. I don't have. I would say there are certain things that they can really, like, do me. Like when I see injustices or things like that, so I mean, I can really feel it. But I never like to steal the handle or throw things out or even, you know, shout. B is good. When will go back the last time you discussed someone a D what was it? Argued? R I can't really say that I have arguments. I mean, just like a real disagreement or argument. As if we came. Well, I would say last summer when. I think it was after a baseball match. There was a group of us and we went to. We went to Shabu Shabu after the match. And I think. And I don't know, it's a kind of tenuous friendship. As if she were a good friend in some ways and we are actually a little distant in other respects. So I don't consider her as someone in whom I would confide in deep problems. But sometimes we have just. She is very delicate and she does not have the same sense of humor as me. So I think she had told me things during the night, which disturbed me. But, you know, I'm just a bit. That's how she's. And then I guess I said certain things she felt. Well, she is really easily offended, I think. But after that, we did not speak for a while. But then us. Then one day, she called me, then we were again friends. B ok. R but like, she never. She never confronted me, never. B had for me. The most difficult decision was to leave my ex boyfriend. B How did you decided to do this? A well was not the case. It was long to come. I mean, I have been thinking about it for five years. You know, he didn't do like fighting or anything. He was a very good guy. But we just had a lot. We were not always on the same wavelength and we had a lot of disagreements like. So I had thought of that and I thought about it and we were already engaged, but we had been together for a long time. So I don't know, I was still. It was always in my mind, as, should I get married or should I not? And then finally we always had. We were always. What is the word I'm looking for? We had these small snippy disagreements all the time. And then one day, we had one and I just decided that I was going to leave and I did it. B It really sounds. A was really difficult. It was the most difficult decision of my life, and I can say it definitively and. But I think it was for the best. B is good. Tell me about a situation you want you to manage differently. One probably leaving my job. Well, to help my friend start a business in Nevada. And I really liked my work. I mean it was pretty good. It was just at the beach. And when I told them I left, they gave me this huge increase and they offered me a different position, which was great. And it was really stressful for me because I had already promised my friend to leave. I would not have obtained the position offer if it was not for her who wanted me to come there. It was really, really stressful. And I pointed out for about three weeks until I share. When I went there, as if we had concluded agreements on the quantity they were going to pay me and blah blah. When I arrived, just as she did not remember told me that I needed a certain amount and that the other directors of the company were, you know, it was a difficult situation because she had spoken with me, but they had not spoken with me. And it's like, well that's too much. And they were also a different religion and it was very strange. I mean they were all one religion. I was surrounded by Mormons and I had nothing against the Mormons, but it was very different because I was a little foreign there. And then also the weather was right, it was absolutely horrible there. So I would say that it is a decision. It's just a pivotal point in my life and I think I really want I just stayed. B yeah. Tell me about an event or something you want you to erase from your memory. A well, if you want to erase something from my memory, then I would probably say my memory. Like really if I could erase something from my memory, what would I like to erase? Is that what you say? I can't really think about anything. I mean even like that, this bad decision that I made, you know, it has value. So I can't really say that I would like something erased. Maybe if I was like raped or something like that and it was really horrible, but I wouldn't. B yeah. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? A well, if you talk about sleeping deeply, I sleep a lot deeply, but I never feel rested and it is a medical problem to me. B Can you tell me? A well, I have always felt like I haven't slept for two days and there are points during the day, I would say that for a few days, there are points in the day when I feel really alert and lively and rested. But they are short -lived. But I sleep a lot. I sleep. B How have you been feeling lately? A fairly crap. Physically, quite crazy. B Sorry to hear that. A well, thank you. B Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? A number B Have you received a diagnosis of depression? R I have not been officially diagnosed with depression, but that's generally what doctors like. My sleep problem has not been diagnosed. I am really working at Make it diagnose, but this is the first thing they are trying to understand. They have already given me medication against depression, but they did not help with my sleep. B I see. R but I feel depressed. B you feel depressed? A I do. I would say that I sometimes feel depressed. Well, my life is very strange at the moment, so there are many reasons to feel depressed. I would say that I sometimes feel depressed. Often, but this is not the case. I would say that it is reasonable, given the situations in which I am. B agree. Are they triggered by something? A They are just triggered by the fact that my health is not great and that life makes life really difficult. But I would not say that he is triggered by something in particular. B tell me about the last time you felt really happy. An Oh there. I mean. You mean for a long time or. I mean, I feel happiness, like when I go out with friends or go and, you know, I find an excellent new dish that I like. I mean, what type of happiness are you looking for? B tell me about something you have done recently that you really are. A well, I mean, at the moment, my friend has just been undergoing an operation, and therefore I stay with her this week. I really appreciate that. I mean, even if we could never live together, I could never live with her in the long term. And I'm sure she couldn't live with me in the long term, but I have fun. And, you know, it's right. I installed the Groupon application on her phone yesterday because she paid too much for laser hair removal. And so I installed her on his phone. And then today, she is looking for cupcakes. So she made me take cupcakes on the way here to bring him as a Groupon. So, I mean, you know, there are few funny things like that. B How would your best friend be. A knock probably. And she probably thinks that I am quite prissy compared to her. I think she would say I have a good heart. We are very different. Probably I am. I should ask him. I don't know. We go out, so I think she would say I'm fine. But she said that I am a very private person and that I know that I knew before they say it. For what? Well, I told you that I had a lot of problems right now, and so I'm not really talking about people. It's a bit of one. It's a kind of Killjoy. But also people can feel. I think people can feel less comfortable if they perceive that you have one. Have difficulties and they feel a little. It's just uncomfortable, like, oh, they may have to help or they feel guilty, but they have a busy life. So, in a way, creates a gap. But I would even say B Before. Even before this difficult period of my life, I was a private person. I don't know why I think. I think a lot. I am a deep thinker. And maybe it's just, you know, not like I felt like abnormal, but maybe I just have a lot of thoughts that don't seem. It does not seem appropriate to share with people or. I'm not sure. B I see. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago? Well, one thing I am regretting at the moment is that I haven't really found someone who spends the rest of my life. So I told myself to focus more on that because once you have reached 40, it's much more difficult. That's it. B What are you the most proud in your life? R I would say that I have persevered. I am very proud that even if I have a lot of difficulties in my life, the fact that I am, you know, that I make this commitment to go to school and that I do it by myself and, you know, it is. It's a bit if people. If people knew all the problems I have, they would be, well, you know, why do you worry about school? But I really think I'm doing this and I'm really proud that even through everything, I get as. B it's great. A thank you. B I think I asked for everything I need. A good. B Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. A thank you. B Goodbye. A bye.

"A There you are. Microphone looks good. So she's going to chat with you. When she's done, you can go ahead and press this button to let me know. B Okay? Awesome. Thank you. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get it started. And please feel free you to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Sure. Yeah. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing great. Thank you for asking, you know. How about yourself? A I'm great, thanks. B Oh, awesome. A Where are you from originally? B I'm from Guatemala. My parents here migrated here to the United States. Dates when I was like three years old. So, yeah. Yeah, it's pretty cool, you know. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B I haven't been there, actually. I haven't been back to my hometown since forever. Just, you know, I have all my family here. My mom, my dad, my cousins, aunts, uncles. So practically I have my. My life here, so I probably be. I mean, it would be nice to visit, but, you know, just my curiosity hasn't, you know, gone there, I guess. A Yeah, I see what you mean. B Okay. I love the people. Everyone's nice. I love the diversity. You know, there's different types of people and imaginations out there. You know, everything's just great. You know, everyone's different. You know, no one's like the same, at least to some aspects. And I love the scenery. I love, you know, the mountains. They're beautiful, you know, great for hikes, you know, taking out, you know, the dog, the family, you know, it's nice. It's pretty active. Yeah. The smog. I don't like the smog. It's just, you know, if you go out further out, you know, you could tell by the air, you know, or, you know, everything's clear, the sky's bluer, but other than that, like, you know, in traffic. Nobody likes traffic, I think. Yeah, but, yeah, that's, you know, pretty much Louisiana is pretty nice. You know, it's. I like it. A That's good. What'd you study at school? B Well, I was studying just basic, you know, I'm not sure exactly what I want to be, so it's just kind of, you know, here and there, just jumping through hoops and stuff. So. Not really set yet. It's still trying to find my interest, I suppose. So what's your dream job? My dream job. That's a good one. I love working with children. So I would say probably a child psychologist just because, you know, it's great, you know, to learn what's going on in the young minds and, you know, how we could help children develop a better way, you know, make children, you know, or help, you know, help them, you know, grow up in a positive way, I suppose, instead of like going the wrong track. Yeah, just, you know, help children. It depends. It depends on the situation I'm in. Sometimes, you know, I could be like super outgoing and just like, you know, and sometimes I could. It just. I could be all quiet or whatnot and just paying attention, you know, if I'm like in class or whatever, I don't really like, and there's everyone talking, I just, I prefer just to stay away from that, you know, because I need something else to concentrate on. Something else. You know, there's like a moment in time for everything, I suppose. Yeah. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B Um, I like to kick my feet up in the couch and like, read a good book. You know, just get my mind going to another, you know, galaxy or universe or situation, you know. It's pretty fun, you know, just, you know, reading and then just having. Just yourself relaxed and you know, feeling good. A That's great. B Yeah, it is. It's just fun. I love reading. A Are you at controlling your temper? B I'm okay with it. I'm not like the best, you know, temper controlling person there is out there, you know, I try my best and I guess that's all I could do until I keep doing better eventually. But I'm not like the best. I mean, I. Sometimes I do have my outburst, you know, but you know, I guess that's everyone. I'm not sure, you know, when was. A The last time you argued with someone? B Ah, huh. That's a good question. I don't remember. Let's see. Honestly, I can't recall. Maybe. My goodness, I don't know. Sometimes I'm very passive that I've just like let things go because I mean, what's the point of making a big deal out of things, you know? So, huh. I don't know. Honestly, I can't tell you that at this moment. A Why don't we talk about that later? B Sure. Yeah. Probably come back to me. How can you feel guilty about, um. Huh. Well, I guess when I was younger, I, you know, could have been better older sister, and I wasn't. And that makes me feel guilty for sure. You know, I could have been a better sister, better role model, you know, But I'm trying my best now, so I'm trying to make things better and it's working. Yeah. A Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Oh, I guess, huh? I don't know. I mean, I'm the person I am because of the events that have happened in my life. So if I erase something, then it just. There's something of me in my present self or, you know, that would change. And I don't know. I'm pretty okay with the person that I am now. I mean, you know, I don't think I would change an event. You know, I'm okay with what, you know, ups and downs and good and bad that has happened. A Okay. B Yeah. A I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world experience explorer. Do you travel a lot? B I can't see your shoes, but I don't travel a lot. But I am kind of like an explorer, I guess. I love to explore, like, even the smallest things. Like if I go hiking, I go off trail and, you know, just find my way up to the top, you know, somehow, some way, and just make it, you know, traveling. I would love to do that, but I don't know, just, you know, always circumstances in my life that doesn't, you know, always something, you know, I'm getting married, children, you know, and all this. So it's kind of like, you know, it would be nice, I guess, you know, it would be nice, you know, I love camping. That's kind of like, you know, taking a few days trips out there camping and, you know, fishing. Yeah. A When was the last time that happened? B It was this summer. You know, me and my husband went camping and it was really nice. It was just me and him, you know, and it was like no one. And it was, like, beautiful because it was just in the middle of the woods with a beautiful lake. And, you know, it was. It was really nice. It just. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was, it was, it was really fun. It was like. I would love to do it again, you know, right now. It would be great, you know, just going out there. It's just. I love the adventure of things and the nature and just life and, you know, overall. Yeah. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B It's. It's easy. But lately I haven't been able to sleep, like, at night right away because, I don't know, just, you know, just I'm laying there and I'm just, like, trying to go to sleep, and I'm just like, oh. But eventually I do, you know, I just. I probably, like, need to position myself in a different side of the bed. Like, sometimes I'm. I'm in the headboard and I'm like, oh, I gotta go to the other side. And once I position myself, then I just, like, go to sleep, you know, but it just. I gotta find the right position for me. Yeah. A What are you like when you don't sleep? Well. B I'm tired. I get tired throughout the day, you know, But I kind of try to shake it off, you know, and just kind of, like, feel like it's a new day, you know, and just try to make the day that I have as great as possible, you know, and then try to, like, make it up by sleeping at night the day of, you know, so. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just, you know, it's okay. I try to make it the best, I guess. If not, then I just go to sleep throughout the day, which sucks. But, yeah. A Okay. Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A How have you been feeling lately? B I've been feeling good. Yeah, I've been feeling really good. You know, a lot of things in my life have, you know, I'm having a really good year so far, so I'm very happy with that. You know, everything's, you know, going good, you know. A That's great. B Yeah, it is, it is. Except that I just got out of a cold and it was horrible. But that's just nature. My immune system has to work harder. A Right. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Super happy was when the doctor told me I was pregnant. You know, I was really, really happy about that. And I was just like, ah, you know, that was really, really good, you know, very excited and just reading about what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby. And that's very overwhelming and it's scary at the same time. I've never really, like, you know, but, yeah, very happy. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I don't know. I guess just me, myself, you know, like, you know, I could, you know, just be myself and that's it, you know, just. I can't really, you know, say I have specific thing, I guess. I mean, it Depends on the person that meets me to tell me. I can't really tell myself, like, oh, I'm this, I'm that. You know, just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people to, you know, tell me or, you know, compliment me or whatnot. Yeah. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Nothing. I think, like I said, I'm happy with the person I am right now and, you know, my flaws or whatever, you know, I might have. I don't know, whatever flaw people see in me, and it's okay, you know, I'm okay with it, whatever. It just. I'm not gonna. I can't change myself for the likings of other people. I have only one body and one life. So, yeah, yeah, that's it. Just my childhood with my sisters and my family. But, you know, it's. You know, you learn from that. You learn from the past and you kind of feel like, hey, you know, maybe I should be a better role model, you know, for my children and so my children could be better role models, so the world could just improve. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Just smile and be happy, you know, and whatever hard things happen, you know, you're gonna get through them eventually. You know, the only thing you can't. I don't know, you can't, you know, go back on is death. You know, you could, you know, a heartbreak or whatever, but. But, you know, as long as I'm alive, I still gotta keep going. Yeah. A What are you most proud of in your life? B I don't know. That's pretty, huh? Most proud of, I guess that I'm trying my best to be the best I could be. And that's pretty proudful, you know, I. I'm, you know, I try to be, you know, a better person each day and try to, like, you know, improve myself every day as much as I can. You know, that would probably be something I could be super proud of, you know, as much as I can. Very hard. I'm not going to lie. It is really hard, you know, because I can't say, you know, it's easy to be bad, but it's hard to be good, you know, and, you know, it's always challenges and everything that goes, you know, in your life. But, you know, it's just. It's. It's sometimes, you know, hard, you know, and sometimes it comes easy, you know, after a while you get a lot of practice and everything's just like, you have a great day. You didn't even try, you know. So. Yeah, you know, loving, friendly, outgoing, you know, adventurous. I guess. I don't know, that's what they say. Just, you know, that's them like, you know. But that's what. At least what I try to be, you know, at least I try to give the best foot forward always as much as possible, you know, even sometimes, even if I'm having a rough day, I'm just like, oh, you know. You know, I just. I don't want to take it out on anyone or anything, you know. Yeah, yeah. A Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B My ideal weekend? Usually I like going to the park. I like sitting down in like a tree. Under a tree actually under a tree where there's shade and just kind of like put my blanket out there, have my dog and like read a book and you know, sometimes if I don't have my dog, like there's little squirrels running around and they like me to feed them. So that's pretty neat, you know, just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the noise, I guess. Cuz there's not silence, you know, the wind and the cars and you know, it's just. It's really neat. A That's so good to hear. B Yeah. A I think I've asked everything I need to. B Awesome. Thank you. You're welcome.

I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally unflinching. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Fine, thank you. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B Montreal, Canada. A Really? Why did you move to la? B I moved here with my mom when I was in high school. A That's a long time. B Yes. A How does it compare to la? B Oh, it's very cold there in the winter and our summers are very short. A How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B It was very easy. I customed pretty quick. A That's good. Do you travel a lot? B No, not very much anymore. I don't have much family in the United States and it's pretty expensive to go back home, so I only go every couple of years, meeting different people, different places, different customs. A I'd love to hear about my trips. B Well, we just recently went to San Francisco. Same custom and everything. But the city was very different and I enjoyed it. A Awesome. What did you study at school? B I took general education and child development. Right now I work part time for an independent auto repair shop. Just working with people, talking to people. A Do you consider yourself an introvert? B No. A Why? B I'm shy sometimes, so I stay to myself a lot. Walk along the beach, bike riding. A That's great. What are some things that make you really mad? B Arrogant people. A What do you do when you're annoyed? B I try not to get angry. But sometimes I do try to learn. I'm learning to walk away from things, but sometimes people provoke you. A How are you at controlling your temper? B I'm getting better. I'd say 75% under control. Oh, about a month ago with my daughter and her finances, it's really hard you don't like arguing with your children? I have two girls. One's 23 and one's 26. One lives in Louisiana and one lives here. A Do you find it easy to be. B A parent now that they're older? Yes. A What's the best thing about being a parent? B Satisfaction of giving love to someone else? Worry. A Tell me more about that. B Well, unfortunately, when I was young, my sister was kidnapped. So when my children were growing up, I worried about them a lot. And I didn't let them do things a lot on their own. A How do you cope with them? B Oh, now it's easy because they're grown and they live on their own. So it's a lot easier now. But you still worry even though they're grown. A I understand. When you think of Cindy's kids. B I'm sorry, what did you say? Oh, my goodness. They're spoiled rotten. They have everything. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Waking up when my kids were younger on Christmas Day. I loved it. A That's so good to hear. Have you ever served in the military? B No. Yes. A How long ago when he died? B It's been exactly two years and two months. Loneliness, depression. Especially after I didn't have any family members left in the United States. So I went to Counselor and then the group therapy. A Do you feel like they're useful? B Yes. A Can you tell me about that? B I mostly enjoy group therapy because you're sitting in a group with other people talking about your likes, your dislikes, your problems, and sometimes somebody else is going through the same thing you are, and you can share what you're going through and what can help make it better. A How has seeing a therapist affected you? B It's affected me a lot. It's helped me cope with things. It's nice to have somebody else to talk to. Yes. I didn't want to admit it, but after a while and feeling depressed for so long, I knew I had to do something. A How have you been feeling lately? B Pretty good. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B No. Just getting more positive. Better. A That's good. Do you still go to therapy now? B Yes. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B It's not. It's about 50. 50. Some nights I sleep good and some nights I don't. Just lack of energy the next day. A How hard is that? B It's hard. Especially if you get two nights in a row of no sleep. A When was the last time you felt really happy? B During the holidays. So a couple of weeks ago. How did you feel in that moment I felt good. Holidays always try to, you know, Christmas trees and kids and everything. So usually it's a good time. Makes me feel good. A Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? B I was married and raising two children and having two kids. I'm very proud of that. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Thanks. A How did you decide to. B Well, I went from full time to part time work and there's not as much work in the automotive field. So I decided to go back to school. School? Easygoing, fun, easy to get along with my mom. She raised four kids single handedly and was a very hard worker. A Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Don't give up. Be positive and anything you try to accomplish, you can do it. Not going back to school sooner? No, because I was raising two kids by myself. So now that they're grown, I have no excuse. So I'm doing it. A That's good. What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm friendly, I'm a hard worker and most of the time I'm easy to get along with. A Can you tell me about that? B Like I said, I'm a hard worker. If you give me work to do, I'll do it. And long as I. Most of the time I'm in a good mood, so I'm easy to get along with, so. And when I'm not, most people just don't. They can tell by my attitude, just not talk to me. A What are some things that you usually put good? B Like I say bike riding or walks on the beach. The beach is very relaxing. A That's so good to hear. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. B You're welcome. A Goodbye.

"A All right, looks good. Okay. Okay, so I'm gonna hand you. B I'm gonna put the doorbell right over here, okay? A When she's done, go ahead and push this button and I'll come get you. B Okie dokie. Thank you. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing well. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B California. A What are some things you really like about la? B I like the weather. I like the people. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B I don't like the traffic. That's primarily it. A I see what you mean. What'd you study at school? B Sociology. A Really? B Yeah. A How did you decide to do that? B It's a topic that just really interested me the most. Out of all the other subjects, are. A You still working in that? B No. A What's your dream job? B To be a writer. A Can you tell me about that? B I like being able to write what I want to write. Right now I write things that I'm not really that interested in, like articles about teenager culture, stuff like that. A What do you think of today's kids? B I think they have it pretty easy. They don't know how easy they have it. A Yeah, I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B Uh, no, not really. A Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Depends on the situation or who I'm around. When I first meet people, I can be shy. But if it's someone I've known for a while, I can be outgoing. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I'll lay down or try some sort like deep breathing. Or just maybe do something that's kind of fun and mind numbing. Like watch tv. Tv? A How are you at controlling your temper? B I'm pretty good. I don't really let anger show that much. I'm not like a. I don't have a fiery temper or anything like that. I'm pretty rational. A That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Um, I actually can't remember when the last time I argued with someone was, because it's been so long. A Wow. What's something you feel guilty about? B Um, I guess I feel guilty about the fact that I don't talk to my grandparents as much as I should. A Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B Um, I'm close with my grandparents, but not really anyone else in my family. A Why? B Because they basically sort of raised me, and my parents weren't really in the picture. That much I understand. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. B Um, I can't really think of one right now. A Okay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Uh, I guess when my sister died, it was really traumatizing. A I'm sorry. B Mm. A Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? B Yeah. Yes. A Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Um, it's the hardest decision I've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband. A What made you decide to do that? B Because we weren't getting along, and there was no reason to stay married, but I still felt like I should stick it out. A How hard is that? B I mean, it was hard at the time, but I made the right decision, I think. A Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your. B My grandmother was a positive influence from a young age. A Can you tell me about that? B She's just a very strong, powerful, sort of staunch character, and that rubbed off on me. A That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Not really super easy. I sort of. I mean, it's probably my fault. I go to bed too late. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B Just sort of foggy and distracted. Have trouble concentrating. A Okay. How have you been feeling lately? B You mean like my body? A Mm. B Uh, normal. Fine. No complaints. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B No, it's been the same as ever. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Uh, last night. I was just hanging out with my friends and was just having, like, a really good time, sharing stories and laughing and stuff. A That's great. How would your best friend describe you? B Uh, probably funny and easy to get along with, but also caring. A Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much. Like, maybe just sitting around reading or going to the movies, watching tv. A Is there anything you regret? B No, I don't think there's not. I don't think. I think regretting things is a waste of time. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Don't try to. Don't go out of your way to try and impress people. If they like you, then they like you. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Um. Sometimes. Sometimes I can be kind of lazy. I'd like to have more of a, like, sort of better work ethic, I guess. A Can you give me an example of that? B Just sort of putting off stuff until, you know, right when it's due or after it's due. Things like that. Procrastinating. A Okay. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. B Sometimes for the things that I write, people will write negative things about me. Like in the comment section on a website. That'll make me feel bad. A That sucks. What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm articulate and funny and a good friend. A What are you most proud of in your life? B I guess I'm most proud of the fact that I am satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world. I'm proud of the fact that I feel comfortable with it. A So good to hear. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? B Just hanging out with my friends, Sort of. People watching. Watching a movie. That's good. Listening to music. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.

"A Okay, looks good. Do something for our purposes. Okay. We'll do this a little bit later. That's okay. B Okay. A All right, so now I'm going to pull up the virtual human and she's going to chat with you for a bit. And then when she's done, she'll let you know and I'm going to give you the doorbell and you can ring the bell to let me know. B Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. A Thank. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Sure. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Good. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B Chicago. A Really? Why did you move to la? B It's cold in Chicago. I see what you mean. A When did you move to LA? B Oh, I think in 90. 1989, actually. A That's a long time. How easy. How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B Oh, very simple, very easy. A That's good. What are some things you really like about la? B Oh, weather, of course. And I'm so easily located to San Diego, Palm Springs, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and things I like to do. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B Smog, of course, is bad, crime rates higher than it should be. And financial, economic problems here. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B Every year. Thanksgiving. A That's great. How close are you to your family? B Very, very much so. We're a very big family. A That's so good to hear. Do you travel a lot? B Yes, I do, very much, in fact. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B I love flying on airplanes. I love visiting new places. I even like visiting different airports. Everyone's different. A Okay. What did you study at school? B Oh, let's see. I started off in pre med. Ha ha. I ended up in physics. Yes, I'm. I teach physics and math and higher level math. A How did you decide to do that? B Well, I enjoy working with kids. I enjoy teaching. My mother was a teacher. My dad was a truant officer. And I've enjoyed it. Keeps you young. A What's your dream job? B My dream job. My dream job would be to be a judge. Yes, in the youth court. That would be fantastic. But I should have thought of that sooner than now. So I'm not going to be able to do that. A Do you consider yourself an introvert? B No, not at all. I enjoy people being around people. I'm very talkative at times. I like to do a lot of things, and I'm very social when I do them. A Okay. What do you do to relax? B Believe it or not, I play bridge, I play chess, and I watch a good old, old movie. A Awesome. What are some things that make you really mad? B Bad drivers, bad laws, politics. Often. What do you do when you're annoyed and I'm annoyed? You know, I really don't get annoyed that much. I just let it go. It's not worth the pain and problems that it could cause. If I can't straighten out a problem, let it go. Go somewhere else. A When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? B Ooh, always my bridge partner. But that's different. As far as anything else, I don't really argue with people. I don't argue. I don't like confrontation. A I see what you mean. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B My parents, of course. Very, very much so. I had great parents. A Can you tell me about that? B Oh, my parents met at Tuskegee, which is a black college. They always wanted me to go to a black college, but of course, I didn't want to do that. I went to Illinois. They're a very positive role model for me. There are certain things that I don't do today. Because of them, I don't drink. I don't curse. I don't look down, people who do. But I don't have as much respect for people who do a lot of either one of those things. I loved to drive. I loved to travel. And my dad used to always take us someplace. Every weekend he was off, we'd go somewhere because we were in Chicago, Indiana, Michigan, someplace in the area. We'd go to Michigan, pick fruit, or we got all our dogs from puppy farms in Indiana, that kind of thing. I had an uncle who lived in Wisconsin who was a dairy farmer. So my dad used to love to drive, and I loved to drive also. A That's so good to hear. What's one of your most memorable experiences? B That's a hard one. I've had a lot of great experiences. I think the best one was we went for my anniversary. We went to Europe. We went to Paris, and we rode the Orient Express. We. We didn't go all the way to Istanbul. We went from London to Venice and then flew back to Paris. That was probably the best experience I've ever had. In my life, I've never really cared for Europe because there's so much here in the United States to do and so much in America. And I've been to Alaska and Hawaii, but we said we'd do something different and we'd always wanted to do it all on the Orient Express, and we did that. Expensive, but a phenomenal trip. Gotta do it once. It's a once trip. Not once in a lifetime. Just once. A Awesome. B Is there anything you regret not traveling more, sooner? We did a lot when the kids were younger, but there are a lot of things we should have probably done we didn't do. I wish I had gone to Chicago. We always go to Chicago on Thanksgiving. But I think we should have gone more than just on Thanksgiving. When my parents come here around Christmas time. But I think we should have done a lot more when it comes to that. A Could you have done anything to avoid it? B Yes. That's why it's a regret, because it could have been avoided. There's things we could have done and we spend our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually familying what's closest to us. I think that people always trade off some lines. Oh, yes, very definitely. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Oh, that's a good question. 10 or 20 years ago, I would have said, don't take things too seriously, but don't be too relaxed over them either. Sometimes you can take things for granted. Never take anything for granted. Nothing's promised. A Have you ever served in the military? B Oh, heaven forbid. No, I have not. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No, no. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Very, very easy. I really have no problem with that. Once in a while, if I am anxious about something or have things coming up due or projects due, then I get kind of anxious a little bit. I don't like to be late. I don't like to make mistakes. So therefore I do have some anxiety issues which will cause me to stay up all night to get things done just to make sure that I have everything right. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B Tired. I don't get irritable or anything. I'm just lethargic, maybe just a little bit. Very good. I was up late last night, so I'm kind of tired now. But I. I usually have no problem sleeping and I get a good night's sleep. A That's good. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior? Constantly. B No I have not. No, not at all. I just came back off a Christmas break. I should be very relaxed now. A That's so good to hear. What are you most proud of in your life? B Oh, I have great kids. I have a son at Young USC and I have a son at UCLA and my daughter just got married. So I'm really proud of my kids. They're going to have a good life. A Do you find it easy to be a parent? B Oh, yes, I enjoyed it. I still enjoy it. Being a parent is forever. So what's the best thing about being a parent? Taking care of someone else and getting them started off to have a good life. I think that that's rewarding. Making sure everything is covered that needs to be covered with your kids. Whether it's their eating, they're sleeping, their clothes, they dress. Make sure they're content. Make sure they have no problems at school or at home or that they're safe physically, mentally, spiritually. Everything. A That makes sense. How would your best friend describe you? B My best friend will say she has not changed since high school. Level headed, but great sense of humor, relaxed. I don't take things too seriously. A That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? B Oh, I love the holidays. I love Christmas. I love everything about it. I love preparing the house for it. I love baking and cooking, freshly baking. I love experimenting with new recipes. And so the last couple of weeks, because the holiday season was just here, I felt fantastic. Everything is quiet. I'm not at work, I'm not stressed out in any way at all. I have no projects to do that I have to think about. Anyway, so Christmas time, holiday time. A That's great. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Really enjoyed recently. Well, Christmas, of course. We went to Las Vegas 27 December. That was fantastic. We only stayed for two days. We had a really good time. We saw a great show, we had some great food. We drove there. We don't usually drive. I don't like to drive a lot, but we drove there and just took our time. A So that sounds like a great situation. B It was good. It was nice. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay, goodbye. B Goodbye. Thanks for listening. How's that one? Okay. I have to ring the bell. My mind is wandering. Here we go. Hi there.

"A Alright, looks good. B So let's move around just a little bit because we have an Xbox Kinect. A That monitors your motion. C There we go. B It's picking you up just fine. Now I'm going to do something that syncs our equipment. C Syncs your equipment? What does that mean? B Basically it means the audio and the video can get together. C Oh. So they'll be in harmony. A Harmony. C Okay. All right, sounds good. B So I'm gonna pull up the virtual human, she's gonna chat with you, and then when she is done, she'll let you know and you can go ahead.

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? C Sure. A Okay. So how are you doing today? That's good. Where are you from originally? C Los Angeles. A Really? What are some things you really like about la? C Well, that's a good question. I like the familiarity with everything. I know where everything is in the city. That's all I can say right now. A Okay. What are some things you don't really like about la? C So spread out. So hard to get places. A I see what you mean. C Is there anything else? A What's your dream job? C My dream job? I don't think there is a dream job for me. No, there isn't one. I'm sort of unemployed right now. So am I. That's true. I studied urban planning. Well, I think this school shooting thing and the NRA seeming to not want to budge on this gun control issue thing. That's it. I try to remove myself from that situation. That's annoying me. Gotten better over the years. Most of the time I just try to, you know, walk away or, you know, control my emotions in terms of, you know, just walking away. A That's good. What do you do to relax? C Just watch tv. Now. A What'S one of your most memorable experiences? C Hmm. I would say my children being born. A Tell me more about that. C Well, I have four children. Each birth was special and, you know, it was a unique experience each time. A That's great. Do you find it easy to be a parent? C Well, it's a lot easier now because they're all adults. But, you know, it was challenging. A What's the best thing about being a parent? C I Would say, seeing your children grow up to be successful and exceeding your expectations. A What's the hardest thing about being a parent? C You worry all the time. You worry for them. You know, now I'm not around them as much, and I certainly worry about them. A That makes sense. When was the last time that happened? C Then I saw my children. Oh, about a week ago. I'm usually pretty happy when I see them. They all have interest. Yeah. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? C My girlfriend. And? Insignificant. A Okay. Do you travel a lot? C No. Around la, maybe, but that's about it. Excuse me. A Why. C Why don't I travel? I don't have the funds to do that anymore or the health. A Okay. Have you ever served in the military? C No. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? C No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? C Yes. A How long is. C About a year. Recognizing that there was some things in me that. That were wrong. A Did you think you had a problem before you found out? C I knew that there was something wrong because I wasn't myself. A What were your symptoms? C Well, you know, I was always tired and not excited about things anymore and kind of lethargic, you know, laying around and just not feeling myself. A How have you been feeling lately? C About the same. A Do you still go to therapy now? C Yes, I do, once a month. A Do you feel like therapy? C Yeah, I do. I do. A Can you tell me about that? C Well, it's. You know, it's. You know, I see a psychologist and we talk about things. I don't really want to elaborate in detail, but, you know, it's. I seem to think that it's helpful. A Changes. Have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? C Well, I think that's a hard question. Let's move on, please. A Okay. What are you like when you don't sleep well? C Irritable? Cranky. A That sounds really hard. C Yeah, it is. A When was the last time you felt really happy? C Oh, that's a good question. It's been a while. I'd say a year and a half, maybe. A Could you say a little more about that? C There's been a lot going on in my life. You know, I just lost my parent, my dad, my last parent. Just a lot of stuff going on, so I'll leave it at that. Well, I still like sports. You know, watching a good game or something usually puts me in a good mood, particularly if my team wins. You know, I like usc. I have a nephew that's a freshman football player at USC. And I've been a Trojan football fan for 40 years, so. Nice yeah. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? C Well, you know, I think I listen well and, you know, I'm pretty much honest and straightforward. A How would your best friend describe you? C That's a good question. I don't know. You would have to ask her. A Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? C Definitely my mother, but she's deceased now. She's been deceased 10 years. But she was definitely positive influence my entire life. No, I have many regrets. Too many to name a number. But, you know, it's. You know, you have the benefit of hindsight and. Yeah, I have a lot of regrets. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? C To listen to the older people in my life. The people who cared about me.

"A Okay, so let's see. B Should I look, like, straight up there or look at the screen? Okay. A Okay. So again, when she's done, she'll say goodbye and then press this button to let me. B Okay. All right, thank you. Okay, thank you. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing okay. A Good. Where are you from originally? B I'm from Los Angeles, California. A Really? What are some things you really like about la? B The food, the weather and the people. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B I don't know. There's not too many things I really don't like about la. Maybe some of the bad people or some of the bad environments in la. A I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B No, not too much. I only been like, to Texas, Las Vegas, and that's pretty much it. Nice. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Catching an airplane to Houston, Texas. Like back and forth to visit my dad and going to Las Vegas a lot. Oh, yeah. Well, when I was younger, I used to go visit my dad because he used to live in Houston, Texas, and I used to catch the airplane a lot and that was a lot of fun. I wasn't scared. That was a lot of fun and I enjoyed that. When I went to school, I studied child development and nursing. I know I wanted to be somebody, and when I went to school, I wasn't sure what I wanted to be, so I kind of took nursing, the LVN program first, and then I didn't want to be a nurse, so I changed my major to Child development and I graduated from that. A That's great. Are you still working in that? B No, I'm actually looking for work. I'm unemployed right now. My dream job will be probably doing something, working with the kids, opening up a nursery or something. My own business. A How hard is that? B In my mind it's simple, but like in reality, it seemed like it's kind of difficult. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Sometimes I'm shy, but I'm really an outgoing person and a people person. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B To relax? I listen to some slow music. I kind of, like, have a quiet environment and maybe lay down, watch a little TV or something. A Cool. How are you at controlling your temper? B I'm very good at controlling my temper. I don't like to get really angry or upset or get to where I'm gonna hurt somebody. A That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? B When I really have arguments, they're like. Because people don't agree to disagree. And it's, like, really petty. It's like we might say, oh, it's just, like, my opinion. And they don't agree with my opinion. So we argue about that. But it's like, nothing really big or anything like that. It's just stupid. I don't even remember. A Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? B Probably not working right now. I need a job. A It can be tough to find a good job these days. B Yes. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Maybe I don't really remember a situation. I tried to really think before I really handle a situation, and I try to handle it in my best positive way before I really do something I regret. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Being with somebody. Like a guy, you know, if I want to continue a relationship with them or just be single. A I see what you mean. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B My relationship with my family I don't have. I just really stay with my dad, and I have a daughter, and we just stay close. All my family, they're either in Houston, Texas, or they're around, but I don't really socialize with a lot of my family. My dad, because I live with him right now, I've been staying with him maybe about five to six years, and he's just the only one I really look up to. I don't really have nobody else around me to really look up to. And that's it. She's in the fifth grade. She's graduating. She's going to the sixth grade. And I'm kind of excited for that. A Do you find it easy to be a parent? B Sometimes it's easy, but sometimes it gets a little overwhelming. The hardest thing about being a parent is being a single parent. It's just you. You always have somebody to bring you joy. I enjoy always doing things with my daughter. It's just about making a Lot of sacrifices and just always it brings me so much joy being a parent. A That's so good to hear. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? B Well, my parents, when I was younger, they lived apart, so my mom. I don't know. I'm a much better parent because I'm more interested about what my child wants to do. I'm involved in her life, her every step. Just. I'm really fully involved. My parents wasn't really that involved. You know, they had a drug problem, so it just. I had to mature a lot faster than a lot of other kids. So it was just my parents and their drug addiction. I wish I could erase that from my memory. How do you cope with them now? I cope with them well, but when I was growing up, it just was rough. It was very rough. Had to do a lot of things on my own. They wasn't involved in my decisions in life. You know, I just. I didn't know how to really grow up and be a kid and which way to go or anything. It just was like I was in the world by myself. Yeah. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Oh, it's very easy. I sleep well every night. I can sleep anytime. I sleep very well. A That's good. How have you been feeling lately? B A little sad, but most of the time I'm very happy. I'm just not happy with where I am in my life right now. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior? B Not really. I really. I try to think very positive and try to do whatever I can every day to look for work and just stay positive and focused. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No, I haven't. No, I haven't. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B The last time I felt very happy was when I graduated from college. I felt very happy. That was one of the best things that. That happen in my life. And that was the last time I was really, really very happy like that. I felt like I was on top of the world. I felt like just overwhelmed with joy. Just. Everything was just so exciting for me that day. I was just very, very happy. Nothing can make me upset that day. I was very happy. And when I think about that day, it just. It's a very happy experience for me. A How do your best friend describe you. B Right now? I don't really have a best friend. I really tried to. I'm. I tried to eliminate a lot of my friends because they wasn't really making a lot of positive choices. So right now I'm just like, I really don't have any friends right now. A I understand. What would you say are some of your best qualities? B My personality. I'm a happy person. I'm an outgoing person and a positive person and a good mother. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Insecurities. Like, sometimes I feel like I have a lot of weight on my shoulders or something. I feel like I can't get through something. I can't get to the next step sometimes. Or just feeling down sometimes. A Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. B Well, I did have a friend, and she was, like, bipolar. And I tried to really be her friend, no matter the disease she had, but she wasn't a really good friend because she. One day she start just being very negative and just talking about me like we were enemies and everything. And it didn't really make me feel too bad about myself, but it just made me pick my friends very wisely. Yeah. Just being friends with certain people that don't have positive things going on with themselves or just don't. It's just when I notice things about people that should determine whether I want to be their friend or not. You know, they might have bad qualities or just some bad habits. They might smoke cigarettes or drink, and I should notice that that's a red flag, and I shouldn't be these people. Friends. Yeah. To stay in school, stay positive, stay focused, and surround myself with good, positive people and just stay on the right track. A Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Well, I went to a friend's house that I haven't seen since childhood, and they. It was just a lot of people over there, and they had a barbecue and everything. And I really enjoyed seeing my old friends that I didn't see in a long time. And just being with my family and certain friends I really enjoy because I'm really always in the house. I really don't go out that often, so just I enjoy being with a group of friends and family and having a good time. A Awesome. B Yeah. A What are you most proud of in your life? B I'm proud that I did get my ged. I did graduate, and I do want to be somebody, and I'm very proud that I want to be a better parent than my parents. A That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Thank you. Goodbye.

"An oh, my hair is in disorder. B So once again, it will start in just a few seconds after my departure, then when she says goodbye, press this button and I will come back. All right? A good, thank you. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started and do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? A yes. B ok. So how are you today? A I am fine, thank you. B is good. Where do you come from? A Detroit. Michigan. B really? A yes. I moved to Los Angeles in 2007, but my family came here several years ago. More like 40 years ago. B How often do you return to your hometown? R I no longer go back to Detroit. B Why? R I really don't like the weather and I really have no reason. Most of my immediate family is here in California. B How does he compare himself to the? A completely different. For me, Detroit was just very cold. It was not the best for my personality. I prefer it. More open space, a warmer climate, warmer people. Just a different atmosphere that I like better. B Why did you move to the? At after my husband and I the relationship ended. I had family here, so I thought it would be easier to start here than some of the other places I had experienced or stay where we were. B How easy for you to get used to living in it? An extremely easy. I came here every year to visit while I was at university, so I was extremely used. In addition, I also took six months in school leave and I lived here and I went to school here, so I was completely used to it. B yeah. What are the things you really like? A well, as I said, time is number one. It's just less crowded. It is more open space. It is a calmer and more friendly atmosphere, less precipitated. B What are the things you don't really like at it? At smog would be one, and when I drive, traffic. In some areas, it can be. But in general, there is not much that I do not enumerate. Like, I suppose, the overall threat of the earthquake. But it's not really a factor because it rarely happens. B I see what you mean. At the price of real estate, it is another that I do not necessarily like. B I'm sure you can say by my shoes that I am not really an explorer of the world. R I don't see your shoes. I don't see your shoes at all. So I don't travel as much as before, but I have traveled worldwide. B What do you have to travel? A new experience. B I would love to hear about one of your trips. A well, I was an international on -board agent, then later, I traveled my work as the cruise company and as manager of the international sales account. So I have traveled a lot of different places and I should say that they were all very pleasant because, you know, there are different cultures, different things to see, learn, take advantage, experience. B What is one of your most memorable experiences? To my experiences, I would say in Europe, by visiting more. So I also visited in South America just because the cultures are very different. B yeah. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? R I would probably say more shy in general compared to the people I know are really, really outgoing. Although I made them describe me as outgoing. B ok. Sometimes what I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? R I like to read, I like to walk or walk or go hiking. Listen to music, you know. B How are you going to control your temperament? R I am very good at controlling my temperature. B when when you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? Ro Oh, probably when I was married to my husband many years ago. It could be a lot. I do not even know in particular, but anything in general could almost turn into an argument of debate with him. This could be, it could be a choice of differently. Some of the cases I could have been with him and me, you know, I became emotional or that I disturb that he had a big deal of something rather than simply, you know, seeing him as not something to answer perhaps, but it would always be where you were also pushed to answer. So, you know, you cannot always say ignore a person there because several times, it is simply a question of ignoring the situation and that does not degenerate. But some people, you know, do not meet the so-called standard. If you ignore it, they are just going, you know, to degenerate. But this is not always the case. I taught college students and you can try calm methods with them, but it doesn't always work. But you always have, as a teacher, maintain, you know, your professional behavior. So you can't really, even when they know, children do something scandalous or perhaps dangerous for themselves or other ki Ds. SO. B I see what you mean. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to make. A well, which could be several, I suppose that a decision with my mother deciding to let a parent undergo surgery which, you know, the result was uncertain, it could go in both directions and in this case, it died. So you know, it's a fairly difficult decision because you don't know. But you also know if you don't do it, it could also be a very serious result for them. B Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. Tell me about an event or something you want you to erase from your memory. An Oh, many different things that could happen. You know, in life, you must always guess things you could do. But they can also be learning experiences. So, is it necessarily a good thing to erase them? You know, if you can consider it positive, sometimes people can have a strong reaction and they do not really look at the impact of the event because there could be something you can draw from it. But there, I grew up in a dysfunction house, so there were domestic violence, you know, and there have been many implications. So you can't say only one because there are a lot of traumatic things. But it would also have been a different result and say, learn to manage some of the things that happen in life as an adult that sometimes I see among the knowledge or friends who have not had very strong experiences, disintegrate or simply have very difficult moments. SO. So just. B How do you face it? R You can listen, you know, because I understand that not everyone had the same experience. You know, you can guide them through levels of understanding and you know, as you know someone, you have a balance of general information on which helping them to shoot and see that things will progress in a better way. Knowing that it is not like the end of the world or as terrible as it seems that it could be. And you can also tell other experiences that were worse or that seem to be. And of course, there is always in general, I mean, when you look at all the calamities of the world, you know, most of these things do not affect us or the people we know here. This therefore gives us a perspective which, you know, can remove someone from their, I will not necessarily say self -absorption, but the apparently intensity of their experience at the moment. B tell me about your relationship with your family. A well, we have a good relationship for the most art. There are different levels of stress and trauma that some of my brothers and sisters have known. It therefore made them interact with life and people more intensely than others. Some have not had as much experience in life that will help them manage things, you know, in a different way. So, this is still evolving, and I walk in positivity as a lead of, you know, the way I answer to try to generate a more positive response on their part rather than sometimes feeding the very strong reactions, responses or interactions they can have. B Who is someone who has had a positive influence in your life? Forgiveness? I didn't hear you. Can you repeat? B Who is someone who has had a positive influence in your life? To my mother. Different teachers, friends. B Can you tell me? A well, my mother has always been a very calm person, for the most part, easy to live, even if she has experienced a lot of negativity. I had teachers who were very positive and proactive and taught independent thought and techniques to overcome some of the things that happened. And just various friends who, you know, I would see situations of treatment sometimes much more difficult, you know, manage things. SO. B ok. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? To this depends. For the most part, it's, you know, quite well. It depends. If I face a lot of things or to study or, you know, you know, trying to get more hours in the day because I need to get things done, then you know, it's less. But in general, I have no problem sleeping. It's just if I stand up because there are more things I want to do. B I see what you mean. How do you feel recently? R I feel good. Less, you know, stressful in general. It is generally going because I have several projects on which I work, therefore. But in general. GOOD. B Have you noticed these changes in your behavior or your thoughts lately? A, I mean, not in particular. I mean, it seems just less stressful because I do more things and stress comes. Sometimes they are much more to do in a shorter period of time, but, you know, reorganize some of the things that must be done, you know, can smooth this. B ok. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? One no, I didn't do it, but I know that is something that a lot, let's say, the veterans in particular. People have. Bright. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? R I don't have, no. B tell me about the last ti Me you felt really happy. A well, there are several, I suppose, and happiness comes in small or great things, but in general. Every day every moment. For me, I mean every day, every morning, this great wonderful day of happiness. Regarding the main types of things, I have no big tops and downs like that. I think this is something that should be on your continuum every day. It can be a very good meal, it could be a beautiful view, it could be a moment shared with someone. It should be on a uniform keel. B How would your best friend describe you? One as persevering. You know, I will continue and positive optimistic. B is there something you regret? Perhaps not to do things differently when I was younger, like spending my money differently or spending my time, you know, a little more differently. But it's hard to say. It's like, okay, like your child, older, you can see, you know, you could have done certain things differently. Instead of buying the house I made, you would have, you know, wait and bought another. I mean things like that. B What advice would you give yourself? 10 or 20 years ago? R I would have been moved to California earlier and I would have instead of buying the house I bought at that time. If I had known, I would have, you know, the situation I have now, wait for it to get something different. But you know, how can you have this perspective? You make the best possible decision at the time with the best information available. After examining several options. B What are you the most proud in your life? To be independent and educated. Able to take care of me. B it's great. Okay, I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. A good, goodbye. Goodbye now.

"A So I'm just answering questions. Okay. She's gonna chat with you for a bit, and then when she's done, she'll. B Let you know and I'll give you the doorbell so you can let me. A Know when you're okay. Thank. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Yes. B Okay. So how are you doing? A I'm doing fine. I'm from Los Angeles, California. B Really? What are some things you really like about la? A Wow. Wonderful weather. Outdoor activities all the time, too crowded. Pollution, Norm. I study child communications. Recently, I just. I would say, yes. Preschool teacher? Well, I've always worked with children ever since I was 18 years old. So I figured doing something, helping someone, it doesn't pay well, but you're investing in the future. Wow. Some job that I could get paid to be outside all day. Get paid well to be outside all day. B Do you consider yourself an introvert? A Yes. I'm kind of quiet, but I also like. I probably would say borderline. I like outside activities, but I mainly kind of do activities probably by myself. So, yeah, I would say I'm an introvert slightly. B What are some things that make you really mad? A Wow. Just maybe a racist or disrespectful person. B What do you do when you're annoyed? A I kind of shut down and reevaluate how I am as a person, how I'm coming off to other people. I can't change anyone else's personality, but I can work on my own. B How are you at control of your temper? A I'm pretty good. B That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? A I usually don't argue with people. I usually walk away. I mean, an argument doesn't settle on anything. Wow, That's a lot of things I regret, but it's not anything that I can control. Probably the biggest regret was losing my mother. Thank you. B How close are you to them? A I was extremely close to my mother. That was who I am as a person, who made me as a person. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A Wow, 20. 10 years ago, I would tell myself not to be so angry, so upset all the time about things I can't control. I would tell myself to Relax and not be so hard on myself. B Okay. What do you think of Cindy's kids? A I think that's pretty cool. I think you should have different avenues to deal with different people. B Okay. Have you ever served? A No, I have not. No, I have not. Yes. Less than a month. I realize I have to evaluate myself as a person, so I can't really look to anyone else to help me unless I start with myself. No, I don't. B Why did you stop? A I feel like as a person, as an individual, I feel like I should be able to control things myself. I feel like to go seek out help is good for someone else. It probably is very good for other people. I've worked with that population of PTSD veterans before, so I know that it helps a lot of people, but I don't feel like it's for me. B How hard is that? A It's not difficult at all. I've always been like a loner, someone who tries to handle my own problems and situations. A little depressed, but I think everyone has a little bit of sadness in them at some point. Day by day, day by day. I just started an exercise program, so I'm trying to look at myself for the solution. I always known ever since I was a child, things move me differently than other kids. So I felt like I was always different. I felt like if I was going to ever understand me as a person, then I would have to work on myself. So. Yes. B Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? A Today. I got to see my best friend after a long time. So, I mean, happiness comes and goes, but I felt happy today. B That's great. How would your best friend describe you? A Wow. He would say, really silly. But still, when I'm around him, I try to be happy. I try to present a situation where we're both going to be happy. No one wants to be around a depressed person. B What would you say are some of your best qualities? A Wow. I mean, on certain days, everything could be my best quality, but I would say I'm loyal, I'm dependable. I would just say I try to be there in the moment. I'm not a person who is really flashy or into materialistic things, so I feel like I'm very grounded. Oh, my mother, by far, my sister. My mom was a schoolteacher, which made me want to become a schoolteacher. And that's basically what I have been doing. My sister has been at her job for 40 years, so I've always had a stable influence in my life. B That's so good to hear. What's one of your most memorable experiences. A Wow. I would say just sitting on a sunny, nice day talking to my mother, I would say that would bring a smile to my face immediately. Wonderful, Wonderful. B What are some things you like to do for fun? A I like to get out and play sports. I play four or five different sports. And I like to go for a walk. I like to ride my bike. I like to get out and be active. Having such a wonderful mother, I mean, I have to keep going back to that subject because we were introduced into this life and that's our first teacher. That's our first teacher and is going to be our teacher for a very long time. And I'm just very thankful. I'm very proud to have had such a wonderful woman as my mother. B Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. A Riding my bike. Simple things. Going for a walk with my sister, exercising. B When was the last time that happened? A Just last Sunday. B That's good. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. A Well, thank you. B It.

"A Okay, I'm going to bring up our virtual human. Okay. Now, I'm going to start her up and then you'll press that button when she. B Okay. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. B All right. A Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing fine. Yourself? A Where are you from originally? B I was born in. A What are some things you really like about la? B I've been gone for so long. I've been down in Georgia for a while, but just. My family's all from here, so that's why I'm here. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B The rudeness of the people. A I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? B Been all over the world. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Hmm. Driving a funny car down a drag strip at 200 miles an hour. A What'd you study at school? B Basic automotive stuff. And I worked at the drag strip while I was going to school, so got to know quite a few people. A What do you do now? B Right now I'm on workman's comp. I work for Amvets and I got hurt at work and I'm on workman's comp right now. A Okay. What's your dream job? B I really don't have one at this time. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Pretty much outgoing. A Why? B Well, I'm able to talk to anybody at any time, no matter what race they are. I just. I'm one of them lucky persons that can talk to anybody. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B I let them do their own thing. I just lost my wife 3 years ago today in Georgia. So that's why I came back here. I had nobody else left in Georgia. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. B Yeah. A What do you do to relax? B Go fishing. Play cards at the little casinos around here. That's what I do to relax. A How are you at controlling your temper? B My temper's fine. I don't get mad very often. A When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? B Probably a bad poker hand. A Can you tell Me about that. B Yeah. Guy was trying to cheat me, and I caught him. So that was pretty much it. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B With my wife. She died from liver shutdown due to alcohol, and she was seven year breast cancer survivor, but the alcohol liver killed her. And I could have done that a little bit differently, but that's. That's hindsight. Yeah. A What's something you feel guilty about? B Just trying to get her some help? Well, she didn't want no help, so, yeah, I could have got her help. I would have. But as it turned out, she didn't want no help. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Turn off the machine. She lived on machines, so I had to turn them off and watch her die in front of me. A Mm. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your homework. B Doing CPR on her in the hospital room, living on machines and stuff. And that's not living. A Have you ever served in the military? B Yes, I have. I was a fireman in the United States Air Force for six years. A How have you been feeling lately? B The last couple days been rough. Other than that. I got a torn rotator cuff in my shoulder trying to get that fixed. And I'm working. Like I said, I'm on workman's comp right now, so hopefully they get it fixed. A I'm sorry to hear that. B Yeah. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B Not really, no. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B I don't sleep very well at all. I've got lots of pain in my arm. A I'm sorry. Why? B It's just my. My arm. You get in the right position, sleep a little bit, but you move a little bit, and you got a lot of pain in your arm. So sleeping, just, you know, might sleep for one hour, but I've been in that pattern for quite some time. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B The same way if I. If I sleep well. It's just, you know, you got to get what kind of sleep, and your body's resting, but your. Your mind's thinking all the time, so. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. Maybe I should have, but no. A All right. Have you been diagnosed with depression? B A long time ago, but I got over it. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B 20 years ago. A What were your symptoms? B I'm feeling helplessness. Just couldn't get out of a hole. When you get into a hole, there's no light on the end of the tunnel, and eventually it comes through. A Are they triggered by something? B Not really. It just. You dig yourself into a hole, and it's a hard hole to climb out of, but eventually you will. A Can you tell me about that? B My wife dying and stuff. And maybe I was feeling sorry for myself at the time, but I just got in a hole and had to dig myself out. And I knew it had to get better someday. So. A How do you cope with them? B One day at a time. A Tell me more about that. B She was always on my mind, every single day, thinking what I could have done for her, but there was nothing I could do for her. A What got you to seek help? B Just needed a little bit of help to get out of the rut that I'm in. And now I'm getting out of it. Now things are looking up. On the bright side. A Huh? Do you still go to therapy now? B No. A Why did you stop? B They were telling me the wrong things I didn't want. If I hear. Excuse my language, they said the grieving period was two or three months, you know, And I still think of my dad, and he died 10 years ago, you know, I said, who. Who said that that grieving period lasts that long? Then they told me, the book says that. And I said, you take your book and shove it, because some people, some people have to grieve longer than others. You know, just the way it is. A Do you feel therapy is useful? B No, I don't think so. I think you have to deal with your own problems. If people. All people have different problems in mine's, you know, just getting over it. Tell me more about that, about getting over the loss of the last 10 years. My dad, my older sister, my older brother, my mother, and now my wife. In the last 10 years, it's been tough. It's been real tough on me. And I got sick a few times, ended up in the hospital. A What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? B I don't go to therapy anymore. I kind of pretty much do it on my own. A Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? B I feel happy all the time. Yeah, Tell me about that. Well, yeah, I've always been a happy, happy, go lucky kind of guy, you know, and talk to my friends all over the country, you know, and say, do you sound good? And I said, well, I am good. And just, you know, I got stuck in this rut and I'm pulling myself out, and that's just the way it is. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Let's see. Positive influence has been. None. Just do it on my own. A How would your best friend describe you? B Well, I see them all the time. They just go along with the flow. Just like I go along the flow with them. They might do stuff I don't appreciate, but that's their own life. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Went on a fishing trip last week out in the ocean. Had a pretty good time out there. And then I go to the drag races, see all my friends from all over the country. So, yeah, good to see them. They're glad to see me. So we have a good time. A Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? B Let's see. Getting away from drugs and alcohol. I was pretty proud of myself. I had to do what I had to do and just leave this situation and go to a new situation. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Thank you. A Goodbye. B Goodbye. Have a good day. A And then you can take the headset microphone off.

"So where is my little button? B I will bring it. Ro oh, you will bring it. All right. All right. My God, she looks so human. All right. All right. Any all-terrain. All right. You are welcome. B Hi, I'm Ellen. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? A yes. B ok. So how are you today? One today is a wonderful day. I simply do wonderful. B It's so good to hear. Where do you come from? R I was born in Cleveland, Ohio. I grew up in Tucson, Arizona and came to Los Angeles at the age of 16. B really? A yes. B How often do you return to your hometown? R I have been back only once since my departure. B How does he compare himself to the? R It is an entire community when I grew up, I am so happy to have grown there because there was a great sense of the community, which I think we do not have here in Los Angeles. B Why did you move to the? A my grandmother died and left a property for my father, so we came here to manage his property. B How easy for you to get used to? A It was quite easy for me. I was still young and it was easy to adapt. So I'm enough gifted to meet people, so it was never a problem. I traveled a lot when I was a child, so I used to move and go to new places, meet new people, see new things. It's an adventure and I like the adventurous life. Oh, one of my best trips that I had in 19 years, I go out with myself, but 1964, I came here to visit my grandmother in Cleveland, Ohio, and I went to an Indian reservation and I had a small note card on the reservation. When I went home, I wrote to the reservation and told him that when I went back to school in September, I should write a speech rather on what I did during the summer. And I told them that I wanted to talk about going to the Indian reserve and they would send me something. And they sent me this huge Kachina Indian doll and that it was a wonderful experience to live. The thing is now worth it if I still had it. I discovered a quarter of a million dollars. So great. But it is one of the best principles. I can be a bit of both. I'm pretty when I have to be. I can be out because I am good to talk to people and meet people. But sometimes I have a little bottom On the late side, a shy little side of me too. So it's a bit of both. I studied business administration by focusing on marketing and advertising. B How did you decided to do this? A well, I really started in computer science, but it was at the time when computer science was not what it is today. And I was good in this area, but it was not an interaction with people. And I love people, so I wanted something that would bring me an interaction with people. So I went to marketing and worked for a television channel when I went to school. So this corresponds to marketing and advertising. B it's great. Do you still work in there? A no, now I'm a photographer. I am a famous photographer. I get a lot of stars. I shoot the red carpet. I run a lot of special events and everything people will pay me. B How difficult is it? It is not at all difficult. It's my passion. I love him. It's like not to work. B What is your dream work? A I am in my dream work. I just need to get more jobs that pay me well because there are many times as a photographer, you have to do a lot of events for free to be known. It is therefore a process of building relationships. I am therefore always in this process of creating relationships so that I can get more paid jobs. But it's my dream work. I love what I do. B ok. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? A well, now I'm really back in it. I was doing it for a while and I moved away from it. But it is meditation. I practice meditation. I try to do it twice a day in the morning and in the evening before falling asleep. I work with Oprah and Deepak Chopra and any other person who provides me with meditation. And I use it to calm my body. B How are you going to control your temperament? R I can really control my temperament. Sometimes I left, I suppose, like any other human being. But I work to try to keep a moderate and temperate temperament and a personality. B when you go back the last time you argued. A OH, WOW. I chatted with my daughter the other day of something I said. And I didn't want to say that it hurt him, but it obviously did it. And we discussed it on this. What were my intentions. My intentions were never to hurt her. And maybe what I said, and that's what started the argument. Oh, God. I felt terrible because I had never intended to hurt my daughter and I would never want to hurt her. And I felt bad that she was injured by what I had said. SO I had to have to keep my words and look at my thoughts. B tell me about your relationship with your family. A well, I don't have much relationship with my. With my brothers and sisters and mother and father. My parents live far, so it's just my two daughters here with me. And we have a pretty good relationship. You know, we try to work on. My daughter is a makeup artist, I am a photographer. We therefore work a lot in the industry. So sometimes I think we are too close to each other, we need a little more space. B Did that cause you to trouble? Yeah, when I say bad things, no. It is never easy to be a parent. It is a work in progress. B What is the most difficult thing to be a parent? Has made good decisions about things. Sometimes. B What is the best thing to be a parent? To love. The feeling of accomplishment. That you have been able to raise the highest creation of this planet to be a wonderful and productive human being. B What are the ways that you are different as a parent than your parents? A I am not as strict as my parents. I give my children a little more freedom to find out who they are. I am not really religious as they do, but I am very spiritual. So I raised them different from me on religious council. And I listen to them more, I think, that what my parents did. It was. You had to be seen and not heard when I grew up and I let my children heard. B What do you feel guilty? One night, I had a bad night that changed my life and I don't want to go into details. I feel bad in this night. B could you have done something to avoid it? Relly, I could have stayed at home. B tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. A wow. I try to think of any situation. Perhaps the treatment of the way my husband and I divorced. I think I could have managed this a little differently. B Can you tell me? A well, we. I think we really loved ourselves a lot and us. It was. It was something that had ended. END. And the way we separate was a little explosive and I think we could both have managed it better. But I think that I played a role to maintain a lot of drama because I was injured that we are breaking and we were a little devastated because I wanted my child to be raised with his father. So, I think that by looking back now, that is to say, you know, the hindsight is the 2020 vision, I could have managed things a little better. But what can you do? You do your best Me. If you knew better, you would do better. B tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. The most difficult decision I ever had to make. The most difficult decision I ever had to make was that I used to work as an inscription advisor on a plane, that I had a stroke, I was going, making a link and to get on the other plane, then go to the hospital. And a doctor was sitting behind me, and he told me that I couldn't get on this plane because I could have another stroke. It was a difficult decision because I was in Dallas, Texas, all alone. I didn't do it. I mean, I was there with an employee, but I would be left alone because my employees had to go to Montgomery, in Alabama, where we were going. And I had to make a decision. Should I stay or should I go? But my life was in balance. So I made the decision to stay and go to the hospital. But it was difficult. Overwhelmed. I mean, here I am about to work. You know, I gave myself up for different states every week to help children be admitted to university. And here, I am on the way to work, and I am on a plane, and I feel this strange feeling coming on the left side of my body. And I say my prayers and I will sleep. And then when I wake up to get off the plane, I cannot remove my luggage from the aerial compartment, which I did every week. So I knew that something was wrong. It was when you see your life and the whole world in your hand and you don't know what will happen next. It was therefore very disturbing, very traumatic. And, you know, you don't know what is happening to you. So the strangest thing, riding in the hospital in a medical ambulance was a strange experience. Yeah. But I'm here, you know, I survived. The doctor told me that no one survives him. A stroke on a plane and I survived. The universe was therefore not yet finished with me. B How easy for you to have a good night's sleep? What do you know? That sometimes I have a little problem with that, sleeping a little. Sometimes I am wired. I am wired just because I am one of these real energetic people and I have to finish what I started to do. And until I finish. I can't fall asleep. So sometimes it is difficult for me to go to sleep. Other times I can lie down and go. But depends on what's going on in my head. B How are you when you don't sleep? A well, I am slow, probably a little on board, but I try to keep an optimistic personality. I am a really energetic person, so I try. But, you know, if you are tired, your body is always Talk to you. So, recently, I felt very good, except that I had problems because I have one. Since I was there, I have nervous lesions in my hand and on my face. And so I'm just. It is. I thought it had been more than a year since I was, but I thought it would have been a little better. And this is not the case. But I am so grateful to be alive that it is really minor in relation to the situation as a whole. And I was not. Fortunately, I have not lost my facial structure or, you know, my face is not screwed up like many people. I can always use my hands. I can always turn with my camera, even if my left hand is reduced in use, but I can shoot with my right hand as a photographer, so I can always continue to do my job. So you know, I have to keep good optimistic energy in progress so that I can keep it. For me to succeed. B Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? One no, but I crossed depression after being struck five times when I was a teacher. Each ball was that you could name. Football, baseball, basketball name. This ball struck me in my head. And I suffered from having, like sleep of apnea, from not being able to sleep after being struck so many times and struck unconscious in the head. SO. B ok. Are you still in therapy now? A no, only I am not going to therapy because I have no medicine at the moment. So I am unable to obtain therapy. They only offer people with medicine. It's hard to get it and I don't do it. I don't work. Yeah, it sucks. I am not working at the moment because I always try to get my handicap so that I can well. Because I want to be a fulfilled human being and I want to be totally. And you know, the system. It will be almost two years before leaving for an audience. It is therefore a little depressing to think after all the years I have been working since I am 16 years old and. And it took me. It's been over a year. It was a year. I had the stroke in February 2012, and we are now in March 2013, and I will not have an audience before September 2013. Just to tell me if I get the handicap or not. It was very depressing for me because I wonder where I lived my savings last year and I had my daughter at university, she finished and now she has to take care of me and she is still looking for a job and. And my life is sort of in the air at the moment because I wonder what will follow. And so I'm just praying for advice. B tell me about the last time you felt really happy. A I feel happy EV Ery Day. Every day, I wake up and I can breathe and I can see and I can walk and I can talk and I can still shoot my photo. I am happy. It's just a good thing to be in the present moment and be alive. B It's so good to hear. Is there anything you regret? To you know what I thought, what is the regret for? You can't change the past. All you can do is change here and right now. So go. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? What advice would I give myself? Don't let anything bother yourself. You know, keep a good personality and an energetic spirit and continue to push. Energetic, talkative, will not take no for an answer. Follow. Reliable, good, fiery, given, magnet. B What are you the most proud in your life? R I am very proud of what I was able to discover. My creative side. I was a visual artist. I never took art lessons before teaching art. I was at the end of the twenties even before I discovered that I could draw and paint. I am a dial collector. My creative side is what I am most proud of because he was able to help me. Be creative. I can, whatever happens. Even when I was still very sick to have a stroke, I could still go out and take pictures. And it was so soothing for my soul that I am happy to have the creative side and that I found it and that I used it. B it's great. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing. A is. Is that it? Bye. Bye. Bye. You know, it was a kind of therapy. It was really therapeutic. She was very kind too. So I come back here? Yes. All right.

"A good. Very well, so now I'm going to get back. I'm going to get the doorbell here. B ok? GOOD. Thank. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. A it's good. Where do you come from? B los Angeles. A really? What are the things you really like? B I don't know. What are the things you don't really like at it? B it's a bit dirty, but. But you have to expect a big city. One yeah. What have you studied at school? B The last lesson I took was a sociology course. I don't really know where I go with school, but I think of sex education. How did you decided to do this? B I think it's really important work. I feel like. Because there is a kind of stigma, I suppose, to talk about sex. This leads, like a lot of dangerous sex and a lot of unplanned pregnancies. So I have the impression that it is a very important job for the world. How difficult? B I don't know. A good. I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B no. Why? B Lack of funds. R I see what you mean. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B It depends on people. But I would say that generally I am more shy. Of course, with people I know well, who are closer to me, I am more out. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B Play with my dogs. I don't know. If it's a great day, I'm going to walk. If it is not a beautiful day or if it is cold or something, then may be watching a program on television that I like, or read a book or something. How are you going to control your temperament? B I would say that I am good enough to control my temperature. A it's good. When will you go back the last time you argued with someone? And what was it? Hobo. I don't remember. I think the last person I was arguing was my boyfriend, probably last week. But I don't even remember what it was. A good, what do you feel guilty? B UM, I don't think I really feel guilty of anything. I would say that I regret things, but I think there is a difference between guilt and regret. For example, I think guilt is more like feeling bad, but regret is like having the impression that you should have made a different decision. And I think it can help you make better decisions in the future. While guilt, you just feel bad without reason and it's useless. Is there anything to regret? B I regret not doing better when I was in high school. I mean, don't get better notes. I regret, as if to get involved with some people in the past. But I mean, I'm not sure that it is about that I can think about now. R could you have done something to avoid it? B hmm? R could you have done something to avoid it? B yeah. I mean. I mean, in the past, yes, I could have made different decisions. I mean, of course, some things, you know, are not entirely under your control. But I'm not going to feel. I'm not going to regret things on which I had no power. SO. In Tell Me Sur Nevette or something you want to be able to erase from your memory. B I don't know if I would like to erase it from my memory, but I want it to not happen to me. Was a time when I was raped. R I'm sorry to hear that. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to make. B I can't really think about any difficult decision. I can't think of any. A good, tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B HMM. I'm not sure. I can't think of any. A Tell Me on your relationship with your family. B I have a fairly good relationship with my family. I would not say that I am very close to my mother, but I mean, we hear ourselves well and that I am very close to my sister. We are fundamentally best friends. A it's good. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? Hobo. Hmm. I think my mother has had a positive influence in my life because she has always been able to provide for my needs and her. She didn't do it. I mean, she made mistakes sometimes, but I think she was still there for me when I needed it and she did her best to rise. So I think it was a great positive influence. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B It has been easy lately. Sometimes I have trouble sleeping, but lately, I have had no problem. How are you, when you don't sleep? GOOD. B It depends how much time I left without sleeping. I can be anywhere, like, groggy to, like, really on the edge and, as, extremely tired. I don't know. A good. How do you feel recently? B I feel pretty good. I, like a type of general anxiety o F all the time, but it is not as bad as in the past. So I felt especially quite well. R Have you noticed these latest changes in your behavior or your thoughts? B I think I have felt happier lately. I wouldn’t say that I’m really happy all the time. I am especially a bit like neutral. But I have felt more positive lately. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B I don't really know if I was diagnosed with the SSPT. Can you tell me? B I know that I have seen psychologists since, as I am 16 years old for depression. And I think my first psychologist, which I have seen in recent years, thought that I had an SSPT, but I don't know if she has ever diagnosed. Did you think you had a problem before discovering it? B UM, I'm not sure. What were your symptoms? B uh, me. I don't do it. A go to a therapist who helps you? B yes. How did a therapist affect you? B It is useful to talk to someone and make them guide you to talk about it of something so that you can understand things. Determine your feelings about things, in a way, I suppose, for yourself or why it helps to speak with someone because you can understand why you feel in a way about something. I mean, I think that sometimes you can do it by yourself, but talk to someone helps, I think. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. Hobo. Hmm. I'm not sure. To Tell Me on something you recently did that you really enjoyed. B UM, I'm not sure. A good. How would your best friend describe you? B UM, I'm not sure. To tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B uh, I think I would spend it especially at home, but it would be sunny and I would go out a little and I would play with my dogs and I would probably have my boyfriend. I would eat food that I like. Like, only the food I love. Like my favorite foods, watch a movie or a television show that I like. It is just like a relaxing moment. But that's good. What advice would you give yourself? 10 or 20 years ago? B I would say to myself. To do better at school, because throughout high school, I was a kind of underperforming. And I ended up going to community college, like, on and outside, because I would like, in a way, to lose all interest and not do well or as well as I could have. So I told myself to do as well as I could at school because I feel like I can be much more than me. And I think I could easily have obtained a scholarship if I had done well in high school. S O I said to myself, you went up to school? And I probably warned against one or two people who were not worth my time. What are you most proud of in your life? B I think I'm proud of myself for not being bitter and wanting to do it. Well, I'm a bit bitter, yes. But I guess I'm proud of myself not to be selfish and want to make people a better place. Like, because a lot of bad things have happened and I try instead. Instead of dwelling on them, I try to do it or I want to be able to improve things for others and as much as I want to help, I suppose, allow people to improve their lives. A good. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye.

"A Longer. Go ahead and press this button. Some people think it's kind of part of it, but if that happens, it means something's going wrong. So I don't want you to sit in here, you know, kind of looking. B At the screen, knowing what to do. So hopefully that happen. A So now she's going to kind of fly in here. There she is.

I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B A little bit tired. A Where are you from originally? Uh huh. What are some things you really like about la? B Diversity. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B The smog. A I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? B No. A Why? B Don't have transportation. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Going to Japan. A Whatever comes to your mind. B Skydiving. A What do you study at school? B Welding. A What do you do now? B Rehabilitation for alcohol. A Okay. What's your dream job? B Astronautical engineer. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Shy. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I meditate. A How are you at controlling your temper? When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B I argued with my mom. She left my college certificates outside and they got crumpled and damaged and it kind of upset me. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. B Everything happens for a reason, so I don't know if I handle anything differently. A All right. What's something you feel guilty about? B My failures. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B I don't know because I usually, as of lately, follow my heart regardless whether I want to or not. Moving off first instinct. It's kind of a mind over matter thing. I put myself in some pretty scary situations, but I've just kept on going and gotten out of it. A Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Nothing. A Mm. Have you Ever served in the military? B Yes. A How old were you when you joined the military? B 19. A Why'd you decide to enlist in the military? B Wanted to get away from home. A Are you happy you did that? B Yes. A Mm. Did you ever see combat? B No. I was supposed to. I got orders from Okinawa to go to a cav unit, which I was excited about, and they pulled me from that and they stuck me in a future combat systems unit, non deployable. And it kind of upset me because I never considered myself a soldier because I never was able to deploy. I always felt inadequate for not having those stories of that camaraderie that other soldiers had with one another, from having the experience of being overseas to Iraq or Afghanistan. A To civilian life. B I'm still adjusting. A Okay. What did you do after the military? B I went to school, studied welding. A How did serving in the military change you? B I don't really know. A How have you been feeling lately? B Up and down. Today's kind of been down. I had some bad dreams last night and some racing thoughts. I'm kind of trying to. I feel like I see the signs from other people, you know, who have been more appreciative of me and been more supportive of me, you know, going through everything and are really caring, and I feel like I'm not pushing them away, but I feel like there's. There's a push and pull in a situation. Instead of allowing myself to fall into the situation, I'm. I'm pushing myself away from it. You know, it's not a bad situation, but it's. There's a un. There's an uncertainty to it that I'm feeling, whether I'm miscontrued about my thoughts. And I don't even. I can't even. I don't even speak on them. I don't even say, hey, you know, because I feel that I'm wrong and that if I do, it'll be embarrassed, not an embarrassing moment, but it'll change the entire situation of something. So I don't want to cross that boundary, which is kind of. It's. It's so like right there in my face, but yet I'm not looking at it. And it's frustrating. It's okay. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B Not since. Since yesterday. I'm pretty consist. No, it's been pretty consistent. A That's good. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B I end up falling asleep. I end up waking up late. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B Groggy I'll sleep during the day. A little more depressed, a little more negative. Not angry negative. Sorrow negative. No, not sorrow negative. Just, you know, hey, Big Bird. Kind of negative. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Yeah. A How long ago were you diagnosed. B From the psychiatrist? Maybe a few weeks ago. Or weren't. A You triggered by something? Tell me more about that. B Snappy. A How do you cope with them? B I vent, I. I turn it into jokes. I'll write or I'll meditate. I forget that I've been. I started out meditation again and it's really been helping. It's still. Doctors aren't really listening, which is really frustrating, especially since I'm on medication and it's really messing with me because I'm on. I should be on different medication. What I'm on now, the medication they have me on is messing with my mood. It's just. It's a whole big mix up and I need to be more assertive and I'm trying to not be so aggressive and assertive, but just to be let them know that, hey, this is what needs to happen. Can you repeat the question? What got me to seek help? Well, I was on a. I was going through a spiritual journey and my mom didn't like it. A That sounds hard. Do you still go to therapy now? B Yes. A All right. Do you feel therapy is useful? B Yeah, highly. A Can you tell me about that? B Well, I'm able to. I'm able to get more to the bottom of things. I'm able to understand myself a little bit better. Able to understand the issues of things better. A When was the last time you felt really happy? B Really happy? The last time I felt really happy is the night that I stayed up for the night I stayed up without taking my meds and I danced. I was climbing trees. I had a good 24 hours. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Real or non real? A Can you tell me about that? How would your best friend describe you? B I don't know. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Yoga, meditation, ride my bike. A Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? B Nothing. A Okay.

"A good, now I'm going to start virtual humans. She will chat with you a little and when she has finished, she will make you know. I'm going to get the doorbell here. Can you let me know when she finished, okay? B Okay, thank you. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started and do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B um, I'm fine. A it's good. Where do you come from? B I was born in San Bernardino, California. A really? B Yes, I stay with a sister at North Hollywood. It makes it as comfortable as possible. A good. Where are the things you really like at the? B I like weather and entertainment and public transport. It is very difficult to find a full -time job and some people are not as friendly as people in the South. Because I lived in the south before. These are the only two things. R do you travel a lot? B No, I don't do it. What are you studying at school? B I was a major in English in college. Do you still work in there? B I haven't finished. Yes I am. What is your dream work? B I would like to be a recording singer. A really? B yes. What decided you to do this? B I have always liked to sing since I was a child. Do you consider yourself an introvert? B sometimes? Can you tell me? B When I am alone, I am extremely, I suppose I would say undressing. As if I had a lot of thoughts and I keep them for myself. So, if I'm in this mode, I don't really interact with people. But I can also interact with people if I change the modes. I just started doing yoga a few weeks ago and last week? THURSDAY? No, Tuesday. What are you doing when you are annoyed? B Usually, I just try to remain silent, listen to the situation, if it is a person or if it is a situation with which I take care of myself. It's boring. I try to think of alternative ways that would improve the situation. Find alternative plans so as not to be bored. How are you going to control your temperament? B pretty well. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B I may have had an argument a few weeks ago, roughly speed, like meeting on time and presenting myself on time. And it was actually last Monday. N o Be just careful about people's intentions and listen to very well, because people generally tell you what their intentions are without even realizing it. A good listener, patient, funny, generous, sometimes depressed, sometimes, but generally a good person. No, I don't have it. Yes, a year and a half ago, I just knew that I often thought of the situations that have occurred in the past and somehow blamed the situation of my future. And often certain parameters. If I see certain types of individuals in some contexts, it just reminds me when I was younger, when things happened and changed my future plans. So I try. I used to try to avoid these types of situations and certain types of people at that time. But now I feel like I better manage things. Regarding being in similar contexts with similar people. I'm coming. I manage these things better. Are you going to always in therapy now? B I do. A go to a therapist who helps you? B I would like to believe it is the case. I don't worry as much. How did a therapist affect you? B It just allowed me to know that talking about problems relieves me about the tension to keep them inside. This is how it helped me. At first, it was difficult to be open with my internal emotions, but now it is. It is good because I know that when things happen, if I am able to communicate about them with a certain individual, it relieves me of the stress of trying to understand everything alone. And often, speaking of problems, this allows me to offer an alternative plan that could be better. Just because I get talked about. I was diagnosed with depression and my doctor said I should probably see the therapy. Are you happy that you did that? B I am. A good. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B It depends. If I am really busy during the week and I have a lot to do, I often try to plan things. And if I plan things, it affects my sleep. I could wake up in the middle of the night. So sometimes it's easy and sometimes it's not irritable, just very irritable. I felt anxious, but now I'm calmer. Do you feel depressed today? I do not do it, but I have last week because I was looking for a stable place where to live and it took so much time to find a stable place where to live, so I became anxious. Yeah, I'm sorry. To hear that. B Thank you. Yes. R when is the last time you felt really happy? B maybe in octo Ber, when my mother came for the first time. She came to visit me in October, and when she got here, we had a good time, the first days. So I was happy to see her. I hadn't seen it for over a year. I am proud to be able to adapt to different situations. The more I get older, the more I am adaptive in different environments in different situations. And I learned to be more ingenious, so I'm proud of it. I'm sorry. My father, my sister, she is positive because she finished her mastery. My mother, sometimes my best friend, is very positive because she has just started her new business two years ago and is very enthusiastic about it. It is therefore an inspiration. What are some things that make you really crazy. B When someone is consistent? I listen to very well sometimes. I give good advice. I am a good friend. I normally do the things I say I'm going to do. So I am reliable. I communicate well and I like the company of people most of the time, especially if they are in a good mood. What are the things that usually put you in a good mood? B being with positive people. The music puts me in a good mood. Comedy shows have put me in a good mood. Good food puts me in a good mood. When I obtained my secondary school diploma, it was really one. I will never forget it. It was a wonderful day. Very confident, accomplished and I was extremely optimistic and full of hope for the future. A it's so good to hear. All right. I think I asked for everything I need.

"A Okay, great. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Yes. B Okay. So how are you doing today? A I feel great. B That's good. Where are you from originally? A I am from St. Louis. Missouri, born and raised. Yes, I've been here a couple times. I just recently moved back two months ago. B How does it compare to LA? A St. Louis is quite slower. B Why did you move to LA? A To take care of a good friend who's ill. Thank you. B How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? A I jumped right back on the bandwagon. B What are some things you really like about la? A The climate in the restaurants. B What are some things you don't really like about la? A The dirt and the traffic. B I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? A Yes, I do. B What do you enjoy about traveling? A The roadmaps, Maybe driving myself. B I'd love to hear about one of your trips. A Well, we just recently got back from Colorado, went up into the mountains, saw the snow and enjoyed a little fine dining. What's one of your most memorable experiences in Colorado? Actually going horseback riding through the Royal Gorge. B Awesome. A Yes, it was. B Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A I would be more outgoing. B Why? A I'm a people person. B I understand. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? A I listen to jazz music and I also draw. B That's great. How are you at controlling your temper? A I've probably mastered controlling my temper through age. It would have been my financial issues. Unsure, unstable. I don't like loud talking or loud emotion. I like to sit and methodically and logically talk about things, not raise my voice. B Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. A Most recently with the illness of my friend. I wish I would have handled his sister a little differently. As far as things that she's wanted me to do that I really needed to tell her otherwise the way they really needed to be done. I took her advice where I shouldn't have. B How do you know them? A I was engaged to him 15 years ago. And he recently called me, I guess about five years ago, and told me he was diagnosed with cancer. We've always maintained our friendship, and I asked my husband if I could go help him in his time of need. And I'm here. B Wow, that sounds really hard. A It has been. B What made you decide to do that? A A lot of things. One, he's a good friend of mine, and his sister moved out here as well. Two, my son wanted to start his career out here. Three, I love the weather and. B I see what you mean. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. A It would be the death of my youngest son. B Can you tell me about that? A I don't know where to start as far as he was born premature, and since he was born so early, I had him in five months versus nine. We made the decision to take him off life support because he wasn't getting any better. So that would have been the hardest decision I made with my husband. B Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. A I really don't want to erase anything from my memory. I have actually learned and experience and gain knowledge from things that happen. So I'm not one to put things. Erase things out of my mind. I categorize them and place them in memories. B Tell me about your relationship with your family. A That's very close. Lost my mother at a young age and all of us siblings and my father still remain very close. B That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? A My father. B Can you tell me about that? A Oh, he's very health conscious, very energetic and exercises and has a spirituality about him that I want to have as well. It's a contentment that he portrays that I would like to have as well. B How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? A No problem. B What are you like when you don't sleep well? A Very confused or skittish, I guess would be the word. B How have you been feeling lately? A Lately, fine, except for the fact that my good friend, who I'm helping take care of, we just got out of the hospital, so it's been a little hectic the last two days. B Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? A No, not lately. B Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? A No, I have not. B Have you been diagnosed with depression? A No, I have not. B Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. A I was excited with good friends, in good company, I should say. And I had just got back from a concert. So it was outside. It was enjoyable music. I was with good friends. We ate well and enjoyed the moment. B How would your best friend describe you? A As a giving, spiritual, normal person? I don't know. B What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? A I can't think of anything that I want to change. Except for maybe exercise. B Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. A I. I can't recall one offhand. B Okay. Is there anything you regret? A No. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A To have save more money and to not try and accomplish everything at once. B What did you study at school? A I started out in cosmetology. Then I went have some college in mathematics and finance. B What's your dream job? A Traveling. B Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. A I like to. I enjoy going. Good food, nice wine and company. I just went last night to a very nice Italian restaurant and was in the company of good friends and family. And we dined and talked and that was fun. B What are you most proud of in your life? A Most proud of? I guess it would be my children. B Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. A You're welcome. B Goodbye.

A really? C yes. What are the things you really like at? C it's in the center of everything. You can go to all the places you need to go without having to drive very far. I like to be in the city. What are the things you don't really like at it? Well, being at the. In addition, you are dealing with traffic, a lot of congestion and obviously the environment. Regarding air quality, it's not great, but you know, you live with that. R I see what you mean. Would you like to say. It was an adult in business administration, so I studied business and after completing my university studies, I pursued a career in retail operations. Have you always done that? C no, in fact, I am not. In a way, I have changed my career in the past four or five years, so I focus more on the side of the human resources of the company. What decided you to do this? C some factors. After working for many years in retail, I changed and worked in a creative company, which was a graphic design company. And I captured a lot of knowledge on the human resources side because I was responsible for operations, responsible for the advantages for a small business. Are you happy that you did that? C yes. I am very happy to have done that. I picked up a lot of knowledge and it is very useful. A it's great. I love my work. You could almost say that it is practically made for me. What is your dream work? Well, my dream work is that I do in a way what I want to do now because I am an independent entrepreneur, I do independent work as a HR consultant using all the knowledge that I acquired in previous jobs. And I use it with the flexibility to do the things I want to do with regard personally and have the time I need to do the things I want to do. And obviously, I worked hard at the start of my career. The financial aspect of my retirement is therefore already implemented. So I do what I have to do with regard to maintaining a certain lifestyle. But also I also like what I do. I'm not as much stress as before. R that looks like an excellent situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? C I am not. Well, I am not completely extroverted, but I am not extremely shy. I'm probably right in the middle. Maybe more towards the outgoing, but I am not completely extroverted. I mean, when I am with other people, I am in a social situation. I guess you could consider me an outgoing person. Obviously, I have my own small private problems that I keep for myself. Can you tell me? C oh, of course. You know, I have it. A few years ago, I had a heart attack and I had bypass operations and it had to do with stress and things like that. I do not speak as much as those around me who are close to me. If I meet someone new, I don't say openly, well, you know, I have experienced this, this and that. I'm just essentially, if it comes back, I won't deny it. Or if it appears, and if I have the impression that it is something I am going to talk about, I will talk about it. A good. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? C In fact, my relaxation is that I currently live with my mother, my mother and she is an elderly person. She is alone. So what I do for relaxation or to relieve stress is helping him do the work of the courtyard, taking care of all gardening and things like that. It's actually very therapeutic, you know. How are you going to control your temperament? C I am not a merged person with merger. It takes a lot to get angry. So, with regard to my temperament, there is not much for that. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? C I try to think here. I I do not remember the last time it was, but it was probably last year when I was a creditor with whom I was dealing to be very difficult to work, and I owed money for certain medical expenses that were incurred when I had my heart attack a few years ago. And they did not understand the situation very. And I really turned upside down because I felt like I was honest with them and I was more than ready to take care of my problems, but they played Hardball and I didn't care. Who sucks. This is the case. To Tell Me on the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. It probably the most difficult decision I have ever taken was that it had to do with a life and death situation with my stepfather who was fighting prostate cancer and made a decision with my mother, if it was necessary to carry out a procedure that would help her, there was a slight chance that it was going to help him, even if it was enough terminal at that time, or it would have really. It was a really difficult decision to make. But, you know, I felt like I was not trying to see if we could help save his life or if we have not taken chance and that we take an additional step, I would regret it in the long term. Real, it sounds really difficult. C is. It was. A Tell Me on your relationship with your family. Well, at the moment, I am separated from my wife, so she has her problems, I have my problems. But we are not divorced. We are just separated. And we always have a relationship where we are still talking. We just don't live together. And the relationship with my mother is really great. You know, she is very understanding. I am a only child, so she likes to have me around, which is good because she is late. She is in her later stage of her life. She is 82 years old, and. And so she needs it. I suppose that it is good that in its own way, maybe fate has happened because, you know, someone 82 years old alone in a huge house is not a good thing. But with me there, I think there is a level of comfort that she feels with me there, especially to be her only child. R which you feel guilty? It probably the most guilty I feel about anything, these are the things I have done to hurt my wedding. Regarding the things I have done, the selfish things that I did when I was much younger, it obviously affected the relationship between me and my wife. Can you give me an example? C yeah. I was taken in a situation where I Worked a lot of hours under a lot of stress. My wife also worked for a lot of hours in a job she had, and we separated. And when she was absent, my form of liberation was to go to casinos and play. And so, you know, I spent a lot of time in the casinos. And what finally happened is that I spent a lot of money. And obviously, it was a major problem with our relationship, had to do with confidence, because it was devastating for my wife. How did you feel at that time? It was feeling. When he appeared, I felt very guilty and I felt less than a human being at this time of my life. A I am sorry. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? C no, not at all. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? C no, not really. No. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? C I have no problems sleeping. I never remember having had no problem sleeping. No not at all. R Have you noticed these latest changes in your behavior or your thoughts? C no. The only thing I could say is that after having my heart attack a few years ago, I don't leave it. I find myself not leaving the little details or the little things in life bother me as much as before. So I tend to be a little easier to live, and my friends and my family noticed it. A it's great. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. C the last time I felt really happy, probably when I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack, and it essentially told me that after many tests and many months of rehabilitation, it was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue, no major scar fabric that had occurred with my heart because of my heart crisis, and my diet and my medication. A it's so good to hear. What are the things you want to change about you? Well, I suppose that number one is my physical being itself. I like to be a little more healthy, lose more weight. In general, just be healthier physically and as regards mentally, do not come back to these ways of thinking where I did the bad things instead of good things and not be so selfish. How are you facing them right. C one day at a time? You know, I'm just trying to be in peace with myself and trying to have a certain peace of mind on a daily basis. I meditate, I read a few books, I watch television. I do things I know if I can. If I can help myself, I do things to help me . Is there something you regret? C There is a lot of things that I regret, obviously, my wedding, my professional career, as far as I had a long career with this great food chain, and I, because of my game problems, I ended up ruining a very good career. But at this point at the moment, I can't do much. I can't change what has been done. So I don't focus too much on the past. I just look at what's in front of me and I focus on what's in front of me every day. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? C what advice? Wake up and see what you are doing and make the changes that must be changed. I am not someone who is not intelligent, but I was smart enough to know what is hard. And what you do is bad. You have to change your behavior immediately. What are you most proud of in your life? C probably what I am proud of it is the fact that I did all these horrible things. But basically, I don't think that as anyone, I am a bad person. I must remember that when I was taken in all the game and compulsive behavior, it is because I had a disease, a compulsive, obsessive and compulsive behavior who made me sick and that I was a sick person who was trying to become healthy every day. This is what my life is talking about. It's about recovering and making sure I have done the right things since the moment I wake up in the morning until I’m going to sleep at night. One day at a time. How difficult? It is not as difficult as you think, but it is a process where you must be diligent on your behavior and your routines and know that what does not suit you, you know, it could be normal for others to do certain things, but I can not do these things anymore. How would your best friend describe you? It is most of my best friends describe me as probably relaxed, generous, a nice person to rub shoulders with, and, you know, they were obviously a little shocked when they discovered all my problems related to the game and the breakdown of my wedding, which, you know, it is not yet finished, you know. To tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. C my ideal weekend usually starts after having breakfast with my mother early in the morning, like around 6:00 am, I go to a local park and that's about. This park is probably arranged where you can mount a hill and go down a hill. It is about three and a half miles. And I walk in the morning, I run my blood and my heart rate continues. And then after that, You know, go home, work in the courtyard for a few hours, take a shower and relax, then somehow somehow back for the rest of the day. And then the next day, I start the same thing again. In the morning, I'm going to walk, work in the courtyard, watch television, whatever. Relax. This is how a weekend takes place for me. A beautiful. Okay, I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. C thank you. A farewell. C bye. Log. A and remove the helmet. C agree. In fact, I made myself comfortable talking to him. GOOD.

"Well, it looks good. I'm going to say it here, so when she is finished, she will make you know and then you can let me know. B Okay, thank you. THANKS. Go ahead and move this cord behind you just so that it doesn't bother you. Hi. B Hello. A thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask you if you have any questions and do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B agree, not too bad. A it's good. Where are you from? B Originally, I am from Chicago, South Side. When did you move to the? B in 1978, when I was 18 years old. How often do you go back to your hometown? B lately, not much. Maybe once every two or three years. How does he compare himself to the? B It's totally different, you know, a horrible time and. Yes, it's just a completely different atmosphere. Why did you move to the? B see that my mother had moved to Africa. I obtained my secondary school diploma and I had a friend here, so I just thought, well, let me try it. A good. How easy did you have to get used to living in Los Angeles? B very easy, actually. Yeah, I loved it from the moment I got off the plane. Yeah. What are the things you really like at? B number one, the weather. The sun is very important to me, so I like time. I don't know, just a kind of more relaxed atmosphere, a variety of people. And now it's my. My attachment base, you know, my friends who are family. So it's a bit like my family is there now. What are the things you don't really like at it? B huh? I guess smog, earthquakes, traffic, just basic things like that. Really? One yeah. I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B I don't do it now, but I did it throughout my life. I have traveled a lot. What do you like in travel? B just see. See other cultures and see more history and meet people and just fun. The pleasure too. To I would love to hear about one of your trips. B See, well, a trip I went to England, Ireland and Scotland and France, everything in, you know, a trip. So it was a beautiful variety. A beautiful. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B I guess you could probably say skiing in Val d'Irre, in France. It was fun. I'm happy to have been able to do that. A it's great. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I am a parent D shy by nature. I tried to grow by being shy, so I'm not completely shy, but I have always been an extremely shy child. But now here at Culver City, it's my environment, and me. I guess you might say I'm not really shy. In. In my hometown of Culver City. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B to relax. I just like to curl up in my bed and read my book, take a nap, watch television sometimes on the sofa in the living room. Just, you know, stay at home and somehow vegetable. How are you going to control your temperament? B pretty well. Yeah, my temperament is quite level. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone, and what was it? B H. probably with my husband, and I don't remember what it was about. A good, tell me about your relationship with your family. B Well, when you say my family, you mean my family since childhood or my current family? Okay, well, I guess my current family comes to mind. I. I have two daughters and my relationship is pretty good. It's good with them, but they are adolescents, which, you know, to leave. They go through a lot of hormones, and they can be a little bitch and. And. But I hope you know, they will grow up. And so early, one day, we will have a very good relationship. And then there is the husband, who. I guess I could say soon to be ex -husband. I hope soon. We have to divorce, but we are always together for financial reasons and. Yeah, yeah, so that. It's not good, the. The relationship with the husband. But. But since we have determined that we have to divorce our. We are not expecting anything from the other, so we do not discuss as much. So it's good. To tell me about a situation you want to manage different. B HMM. Wow. I guess our marriage. I would have liked to notice very early, you know, it was, like far from what I thought. To Tell Me on the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. B See? Oh my God. Most difficult decision. I guess leaving my first husband, it was quite difficult. Can you tell me? B well, you know, we were married and I was not satisfied, I guess you could say. And I simply abandoned our relationship. Now that I look back, I think it's because I wanted children, and it would have been happy to never have them. And so as I had no father, it was very important that I create children with someone who comes to You wanted to be a father. And so I was a little at an age when I had to start thinking about having children, but I was with someone who was really not there. So that I think that is perhaps a main reason why I was not satisfied. And I just had the impression that this marriage would not work. And so, you know, we went to therapy and everything, and he didn't want to break, and. And I had to leave him because I was simply not happy. And that. It was very difficult because, you know, I felt like it hurts him, which. What I was, you know, and he survived. He reaches it. Now he is married to two children, but it was difficult to leave him. One yeah. Tell me about an event or something you want you to erase from your memory. B HMM. Something that I would like to be able to erase from my memory. I have to think about it. I'm sure there is something. Ah, well, yes, there are. I guess it would be pleasant to erase a recent from my memory. I am not recent, but an event in my recent adulthood here at Culver City, where one of my best friends I betrayed. Years ago, when my husband entered real estate for the first time, she and her family grew up and they really needed a larger house. And we just supposed, you know that they would use my husband as their agent, both to sell their current house. Current at the time and to buy a new house. And as he turned out, they surprised us and had spoken to this other local agent. And, yes, it was devastating. I don't think I have been betrayed like that. So I want to be able to erase this now because now you know, it was at the time when the children were very young. And my daughter at the time, my youngest daughter was, let's say six, maybe. Maybe five. Anyway, my best friend's daughter is the same age. They were born a few days from each other. We were pregnant together and they were really tight, these two little girls. And they ended up not going to the same primary school, so they could not drag during these years. But whenever we meet them in the neighborhood or they encountered a summer camp or something, they were so connected. They were fair, you know, like two peas in a pod, even if theirs. Their mothers were no longer talking. So now, they are 13 and 14, and they are in college together, and they are always very connected. In fact, her. She, for the first time, spent the night with us last night with my daughter and another girl. And it's just a little annoying, you Know, because now these girls become very good friends, best friends. And yet, I always have this bad living memory of what it. His mother did it. In my opinion. What was 10 years ago, about eight years ago. Anyway, I tried it. I tried to ignore it and put it out of my head, which I have done in recent years, but obviously, it still appears. Anyway, that. It was. That. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B not so simple. I sometimes spend a decent night, but sometimes it is difficult to fall asleep. And most of the time, I wake up and I can't go back to sleep. Or I finally get asleep and then it is almost time to get up. You know, this difficult thing. Well, the alarm clock in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the toilet. And then, you know, it's not always so easy to go back to sleep. And then I wake up again to go to the bathroom. So I assume that it is the trigger with regard to sleep. Do you have trouble there? I don't know. I think there are too many things in my mind, which crosses my mind during the day, and I feel like I haven't done enough during the day. It is therefore difficult for me to go to sleep when I am supposed to do it, I suppose. What are you when you sleep? GOOD. B I'm a bit used to it now. I just spend through the day probably looking for. The tired air. And I'm a little used to feeling tired. I just do what I have to do. And sometimes, if I am able, if I am at home and I have no huge commitments. Yes, I could, as I said earlier, take a nap or something, read my book, watch TV, no matter. Lately, how did I feel? A little towards me, in life. Can you tell me? B well, I have this need awaiting divorce of separation. I was afraid of having made a lot of mistakes with my daughters. Now they are adolescents, you know, on the verge of adulthood. And so I fear that, you know, I did all kinds of things with their advice and their early childhood, and now it is too late. Like, I missed a lot and, yes, I need a job. I am unemployed. I don't know what I want to do with my life. I know I want to do something. I. I just want, you know, I have never finished university, unfortunately, because I was traveling and all that. I regret it extremely. And I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself because I need to divorce and continue my life. So now, I forget what was the initial question, but it is the state. A game of th E state of my life. A good. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B yes. How long have you been diagnosed? B well, the first time or recently? The first time, I guess, it was, you know, when I was at the start of the twenty. I was just a little upset. By coincidence, it was another break that I had to make. At the time, I was at the beginning of the twenty and I had to break up with my boyfriend. But again, it was very overwhelming because I. You know, it was difficult because he didn't want to break up, and I felt like I was hurting him. And I didn't understand this feeling. I was really upset and I didn't do it. It was the first time that I suffered from depression, so I didn't really recognize it as a depression, but I went there. In one way or another, I had knowledge or. I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist. I remember that I paid her on time, and she prescribed Xanax to help relax. And so I guess it helped me get through it. And then I had a depression over the years. Just you know, small pieces here and there for various reasons. Such as? I guess it's generally a relationship, you know. Yeah. So the last time I was diagnosed and put on medication was probably about two years ago. Are you going to always in therapy now? B no no. Why did you stop? B Silver. I have no insurance, otherwise. Yeah, I would be happy to go to therapy. Anything that could help. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B ooh, boy. The last time, I felt really happy. I don't know. I guess maybe when my children were born. It is, I suppose, happy. I don't know. I just know, you know, I always wanted children, so it was nice to have them. It is. I don't know. That's all I can remember. I guess I don't remember good times too much. I remember bad times. To Tell Me on something you recently did that you really enjoyed. B HMM. Something I did that I really enjoyed it? Well, let's see. Friday evening, I went to a friend and I met five other friends, and we created vision paintings and spoken and dinner in one of their house. It was. It was fun. Yes, we can stay at university, get my diploma, get therapy, try to become happy. Yeah. Try to understand things earlier in life, like, yes, stay at university. And above all, I think the main thing, you know, what everything comes down to. No matter what you are depressed, it seems that the saying goes and the songs go, you know, it's all about money. The world revolves around money and not having e. It is in itself very depressing. So, in addition to the relationships and different things that have happened in your life, there is no money, it is, you know, it is as if you could not even try to repair anything because you do not have the money to repair it. So, in this spirit, I would certainly advise myself to obtain my university diploma and get a job and stick to that. Do not stop to go on a trip. You know, simply respect the work, stay with a business, build your seniority, keep your advantages and accumulate knowledge or expertise in a sort of domain. Yes, it would have been my biggest advice for me. A good. What are you most proud of in your life? B Not much, I suppose, just my daughters. You know, these are beautiful girls, and I am proud and happy to have been able to have children. Some people are not even able to do it, you know, and they try so hard or they look at their lives and they want to have done it. So it's the only thing. I mean, I wanted five children and I always wanted a boy, which I never had. But I suppose it is the greatest thing that I can think of being proud of, it is to have my two daughters. Do you know that you are some of your best qualities? B I am a very faithful friend and person. This is why when this friend betrayed me, it was so devastating. Yeah, very loyal, very happy. What was I going to say? I was going to say, happy. Go lucky. I don't know where it comes from. Very. I wanted to say friendly and attentive and. Yeah, I care about people and I am interested in people and I also care about animals. This is another thing that I am proud of. Proud to be a vegetarian. Yeah. So my daughters and be a vegetarian, and I am a vegetarian because I really care about the feelings of other beings, not only humans, but also animals. And, you know, I don't think animals should be tortured and live a tortuous life just so that we can eat them. So what was the question? Do you remember the question? A good. I think I asked for everything I need. B ok. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. B nothing. Bye. I needed fabrics once, so it's good.

"A How we know it's working. Okay, so if you move your arms around a bit. B Should I move my arms around? A Oh, so that just shows that it's active. We know that it's working. Okay, so now I'm going to do something that we. Seems really silly, but we're going to take our equipment and now I'm going to start up the virtual. She's going to ask you some questions and chat with you. And when you're done, she'll let me know you're done. B And if it's not, it would say, don't answer that. If I said I don't answer that. Just remember, that's all. Okay, that's all. Do I push a button to start or does she start on her own? Okay. Impressive. A People in safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Fine. How about you? A I'm great, thank. Where are you from? Originally? B Here. A Really? B Yes. A What are some things you really like about la? B The weather? The weather? Mainly, yeah, the weather. Sorry, not the people, but some of the people. Stuff like that. Some people, yeah. Okay, I'm cutting you off. Not as much as I used to. I used to be in school and used to travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that. But I'm not at school right now. Later on I'll get back into school, I'll travel more, but right now mellowed out. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B I don't. I don't enjoy traveling. A What do you study at school? B That's a good question. You're actually pretty good. I studied physics and aerospace engineering. But physics mainly. Yes, I am actually. Right now I teach community college physics and astronomy. But I still do research in physics also because I like that type of thing. And I'm going back to grad school. Hopefully that's why I'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire. Impressive Professor. At a place like USC or UC or LA or something like that where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest. You are actually pretty good at this. There's a lot of people. The first one, I guess is my physics teacher. An AP physics teacher in high school. Even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major, he still was a very good influence he told me, you know, he's the first one who taught me that school was not about a grade but about learning. Okay. I'm pretty good. I think I'm single so I don't get in many arguments. But it's probably my brother about he doing silly things too. Playing a video game together. I know I'm pretty old to play video games, but they're actually pretty good. It's probably something like that and being angry at him and him trying to offend himself and me being right. That's all fairly close. I see them pretty often. Parents. I see them a couple times a week. They're getting older so I help them with groceries and things like that. And my brother, I see same with them, same time. My sister, I tutor her kids, my nephews, so I see them about once a week also interesting. Yes. Because I spend long periods of time doing math and reading and not talking to anybody. That's introverted. I guess I play video games or. And I work out. I work out. I think a lot. I try to at least. A What do you do when you're annoying? B I roll my eyes. Which I've been told is a bad thing. And that's about it. I think. Bad parenting basically. Parents are more self centered, more into themselves, unlike previous generations. And the kids just do what they want because parents aren't there. Parents aren't being parents. My own personal opinion. A That makes sense. What's one of your most memorable experiences? B I guess. Thank you. A Best friend described. B I don't really have a best friend. Introverted, remember I'm biased obviously, but they are. I'm really good at math. I'm not really sure if you can't. Not saying you can't get better than me in math. But the thing is it's just that you reach certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out. I am patient, I think and I am disciplined. Where I can spend many hours, many, many, many hours reading books that might not be important, but they might be important so I have to do it anyway. That type of thing. A What are some things that usually. B When I a good workout doing well in video games. Small little things like that. When something happens with my. My research type thing, mathematical physics type thing. When it goes well that most puts him. That puts me in a good mood. Thank you. Right now is the fact that research that I did, I did make it this far research wise. That's all. That's all interesting. When you start off in school you read about Einstein and things like that. He says general relativity and you hear about particle physics and you have no idea what it is. You know, it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics. And you start to realize you're interested in that, but you're not sure if you can actually make it. And eventually, each step, as long time goes by, as time goes on, you get closer and closer. Eventually you make the goal. Eventually you realize you are just not as good as Einstein. But you are up there. You can do research in physics, you can add to advanced knowledge and science. And that's impressive that you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid. Okay. A few weeks ago, when I got a good grade in a class. Thank you. Yes, Briefly. Many years ago. Yes. I don't know. Growing up, I always thought that was. I always thought it was my dream when I was a kid. That's why. And I just went about doing that. I was National Guard, I think about 18, 19. I got commissioned at 2021. I was only in for about a year, so I left at 22. Yes. Not really. A How did. Certainly change you. B I don't think it did. I think it's just something you grew up. Something I grew up already expecting to be something really changed me as much. Graduate school and physics. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Nope. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B It depends if I work out really hard the day before. If I work out pretty hard, it's bad. But if I don't work out, I don't know. It's hard, I guess moderately. Thank you. Yes, it's okay. Probably like I am now. Normal, I think. Not as. Not as happy about everything, but still pretty okay. I can still function. No. Maybe slightly. Sorry. No. Yes. Yes, I have changes my thoughts. Applying to grad school again. It's been a while. And slightly apprehensive. Happy that it looks good, but apprehensive that it might not be good. Things like that. A How hard is that? B What do you mean by that? I know it's your computer, but. As in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts or how hard is it to go into grad school? Understand. Okay, I agree. No, not really. Probably keep doing what you're doing. Even though I'm not that old. Believe it or not, 20 years ago, I was probably 15. No, no, I was 15. Just keep doing what you're doing. I think I was very lucky and fortunate the way it worked out if it was a little bit different. I don't think it worked out so well. Even though it's not perfect now, I think I'm doing really well personally. Thank you. Same here. Goodbye. I'll keep this on. Take this off now.

"A Okay, great. So she's going to chat with you for a bit. Actually, before I do that, one last thing. Perfect. Okay. When she's done, you can press the doorbell. B Okay? Okay. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Sure. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing alright. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B New Jersey. A Really? B Yes. A When'd you move to la? B Three months ago. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B Not very often. A How does it compare to la? B It's much different. I don't know, it's a lot more crowded here. A Why'd you move to la? B To start a new life for myself. A How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B It wasn't very easy at all. It was quite rough at first, but you know, I'm still trying to get used to life here. A What are some things you really like about la? B I've met some good friends here. You know, I love the Hollywood area and just, you know, the mountains are beautiful. That's kind of things I love. A Uh huh. What are some things you don't really like about la? B Hmmm, the traffic. A I understand. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B Not really, no, I don't. A Why? B Just haven't had the time or the finances to. A Okay. What'd you study at school? B Digital media. A That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? B Well, I've always loved, you know, computers and you know, designing things and I don't know, I just kind of fell into it. A Cool. Are you still doing that? B No, I dropped out. A I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? B Well, I guess my dream job would be working in something that I went to school for. I never really completed my education. A But. B I guess it'd be great if I went back to school and finished my degree in digital media and finished started working doing something in that field. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B A little bit of both. You know, I can be shy at times, but I like to push myself to be outgoing. You know, it's kind of a struggle for me, but I don't want to be, you know, in a shell, so I kind of force myself to be outgoing. A Yeah. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B Listen to music. I sometimes just drive and, you know, play music in my car, and that helps me relax. A Nice. B Or I smoke a cigarette. Oh, like what? Oh, just heavy metal. That's all I listen to is metal. A Awesome. How are you at controlling your temper? B Well, it depends on how high my stress level is and how angry I am, but I do my best to not get so pissed off. A You argued with someone and what was it about? B And I don't know. She. She wanted me to come and pick her up. She was a little drunk and we just kind of fought over the phone over some other things, and I just ended up not picking her up because of her attitude on the phone with me. A That sucks. B Yeah, it does. A What's something you feel guilty about? B Something I feel guilty about is not talking to my kids often, or as often as I should. I've just been so busy with trying to get myself all situated here that I don't really have time to, you know, talk to my kids as much as I'd like to. A Yeah, that sounds really hard. B You have no idea. It comes natural, but it's no way easy. It's the hardest job that I love to do, but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away. And I made this choice to come out here to la, and I feel bad that I don't see them, you know, but the reason I came on here was to better myself so I can provide for them. A What's the hardest thing about being a parent? B Fear. You know, just fear what. You know, you fear what's going to happen to your kids. You fear that something awful is going to happen. And not seeing them brings about that fear a lot more, you know, and I can't. I can't always be there with them. I can't see them. You know, it wasn't as bad when I was living in Florida, and at least I used to see them. It wasn't very often, but I still used to see them. Now I don't see them at all. And that's the. That's the hardest thing I've had to do as a parent is to step away from my kids, if only temporarily. I don't know how long I'M gonna be here for. I don't know what my future holds, but the hardest thing is being so far away from them. A Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. What's the best thing about being a parent? B Just the joy that they bring to me. I mean, I could be having a bad day, and they just cheer me right up. I mean, it sucks being away from them for so long and they're so far away and just not seeing their faces, it's the worst thing ever, you know, But I love to just see their faces. They just bring a smile to my face and. I don't know. A What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? B Well, I think the fact that I can get down to their level, I'm a bit goofier as a father than my dad was with me. My dad was, you know, strict all the time. Sure, he used to, you know, laugh and play with us, but, you know, he was always very reserved, you know, and he kind of held back a lot of his emotions just because, you know, he was a. He was a strong, very tough guy. But with me, I'm very goofy and silly with my kids, and I'm strict when I have to be, but I always love to play around with them as much as possible. I don't want them to grow up too fast. That may have been. Yeah. A Tell me about a situation that you. You wish you had handled differently. B Wow. A situation that I wish I would have handled differently. There's so many, I guess when I was still with my ex wife in Florida. I wish I wouldn't have gotten so angry or I wish I wouldn't have let her get. Get the best of my emotions. She had a tendency to get underneath my skin and, you know, keep picking at me until I exploded and I allowed her to do that. You know, I should have just walked away when I could and, you know, not let my temper get the best of me. A Okay. Have you ever served in the military? B No. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Sometimes it's hard. Sometimes I just lay awake in bed, you know, thinking all the things that are going through my head, all the, you know, all the stress that I'm going through with work and, you know, making sure. Wondering if I'm gonna. If I'm gonna be able to make, you know, rent, you know, wondering what my kids are going through, you know, when I'll see them. Again, if they even care about me anymore, if they even know they have a father. You know, those are some of the things that run through my head and that keeps me up at night sometimes. A Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? B A little. But you know, I put myself in a situation so, you know, I gotta be bear with it, you know, I gotta reap what you sow, so I gotta deal with it in my own way. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B Lately I've been trying to not think so much about, you know, all that's going into my life. I try to distract myself and that kind of gets me in a better mood. You know, if I hang out with friends or just watch a little tv, something to get my mind off, you know, all the stresses in my life. A That's good. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B The last time I felt really happy was actually a couple of nights ago. I went out drinking with a couple of my friends from work and I don't know, we just got pretty drunk and that kind of helped me to forget all the crap that was previously going through my head. So if I can distract myself, if I can forget about all that other stuff, then I'm happy. A Uh huh. What would you say are some of your best qualities? B Some of my best qualities? I guess that I'm convincing. Kind of like a. I guess you would say, counselor to some people. You know, some of my close friends, you know, I may talk people into doing things that they may regret or I may, I mean, I'm sorry, to talk people out of things that they, you know, may end up regretting or I may, you know, just listen to people so, you know, I can say that, you know, I definitely, you know, listen to my friends and help them out in their time of need when they're going through some troubling times like, like I'm going through. A Can you give me an example of that? B Who lives in Florida? You know, I talk to him every now and then and he's been having troubles with his girlfriend and you know, I just kind of talk to him about his problems and listen. I mainly listen because, you know, I don't think he has anybody else to listen to. You know, when I was living in Florida, I was very close with him so, you know, he'd always relied on me and now that I'm here in la, I don't want to lose that, you know, connection with him because, I mean, I've always been there for him. So he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice, you know, about what I think, you know, he should do. So I think he appreciates that. And I. And I'm glad that he, you know, relies on me for that or that he trusts me enough to tell me all that stuff. A That's great. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B I don't know. Sometimes I wish I wasn't so kind or generous. It seems bad, but sometimes people may take advantage of me and I may not realize it. And I don't like saying no to people. I like to always please people. So if I can change that, maybe I wish I wasn't such a people pleaser. A Has that gotten you in trouble? B Sometimes. Financially in trouble? Sometimes. You know, I, you know, help others and, you know, that may make me broke sometimes. I may not have enough to pay bills, but I feel better helping people. I don't know. A Yeah. Is there anything you regret? B I regret not breaking up with my ex wife sooner because she put me through so much crap in my life. And I was always trying to be a people pleaser. I was trying to please her, you know, trying to please my kids as much as I can by not breaking up, you know, the family. But there's only so much one person can take and. And I think probably if I would have left sooner, I may have been happier and things may not have gotten so out of control, out of hand like they did, you know, during all those years with her. So if I would have got out sooner, I don't know, I would have been happier, I guess. A I see. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B It's okay to be selfish. It's okay to, you know, think about yourself sometimes. You know, if you keep putting everyone ahead of you, then you're not thinking about yourself. You're not thinking about what makes you happy. Even though pleasing people may make you happy, you have to think about yourself sometimes too, and about your needs. Because, you know, you play an important role in the lives of your close family members. And in order to keep everything afloat, you sometimes gotta worry about the one person that's, you know, juggling everything and holding everything up, which is yourself. So be a little selfish sometimes. It's okay, right? A Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B I don't even know what a weekend is anymore. My ideal weekend would be locked away alone in my room, watching movies, listening to music, just with my cell phone off and not being with anybody or it could be out at a bar watching a metal show. So I like to be alone, but at times I do want to be out with others. I like, you know, being around people. A How would your best friend describe you? B Crazy. He thinks I'm. I'm crazy for coming out here. But I guess you would say that I'm dedicated and that I'm strong minded and that, you know, whatever I set my mind to, I can do it, you know, no matter how hard it is, I'm not gonna wimp out. So, I mean, I really respect him for giving me his insight, but I guess, yeah, I guess you'd say that. Crazy but strong minded. A What are you most proud of in your life? B My kids. You know, that's the one thing that brings joy to me, you know, like real, real joy are my kids. And, you know, just having them in my life is the proudest thing I can ever accomplish is just, you know, having them in my life. And although I don't get to see them as much, even when I think about them, just thinking about, you know, how far they've gone, you know, what they've accomplished in their, you know, in their short time, yeah, it makes me happy and I can't wait to see them again. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B One of my most memorable experiences, I guess that would be in Florida, you know, going to see our, you know, a favorite band, Skeleton Witch. And it was a great night overall, you know, one of the nights I'll never forget. Just because we've been looking forward to it for, you know, so many months and, you know, when it finally happened, it was surreal. It was a great night after all, you know, overall, nice. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Sure. You're welcome. A Goodbye. B Bye. Take that off.

"A Technology to understand what you said. And then she's going to use a very complex series of equations to decide how to answer you and how to keep the conversation moving. So she also uses software that incorporates the webcam and the Xbox Kinect, and she uses that to recognize your facial expressions and your posture so that she can take your feelings into account as the interview progresses. B All right. C Where'S the start session? Is this just this one. I'm sorry, at the start session button. A Oh, that's not the one that we're doing today, so. C Yeah, that one. So you're just gonna see here for a second and then I'm gonna. It. Sorry, it just takes a lot and. A Actually looks like we're just going to have to adjust this just a little bit to make sure that your whole face is in the frame. C So. A So she's going to ask you some questions and then when she's done, she's going to say goodbye and then you're going to press this doorbell to let. B Us know that you guys. C Okay. Okay. A Thank you for your patience. C Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming. Coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. C So how are you doing today? B Say again. Say again. C Great. Where are you from originally? B San Bernardino, California. C What are some things you really like about la? B The weather is nice. What else do I like about la? It's very sunny and I like the people here. I don't like how spread out it is. And along with that, I don't like the lack of public transportation and I don't like that everything shuts down at 2am an introvert? Yes, I do. C Why? B Why? Because I tend to be very stoic. I don't tend to, I don't know, express myself so much and I tend to be very reserved and not really forthcoming about my feelings, etc. C Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I'm not sure I understand the question exactly, but I. I can't really say. I just. I just retreat within myself and I don't tend to express what I'm thinking or feeling. If that makes sense. Say Again. Say again, please. What, what do you do when you're in Hawaii? What do I do when I'm alone? I ride a bicycle a lot. I ride a bicycle like very, like everywhere. I'm a bicycle commuter and I also like when I'm alone, like on the bus. I'll read. I'll bring a book with me and I'll read a lot. C How are you at controlling your temper? B I'm very good at controlling my temper. I don't, I mean, I'm so good at repression, repressing my feelings that I very rarely express. I mean, I don't know, I don't really express anger. Also, I don't really feel anger because I'm not an angry person. I may be very disappointed at when something bad happens, but I won't erupt in a rage. I don't really feel rage, but I, you know, I'm sort of exposed to it all the time on the road. I see people like, you know, yelling at each other and screaming and so it's. Yeah, I sort of like cultivate my serenity. C When was the last time you argued with someone? B Last time I argued with someone it would have been a job related argument. And what did I study in school? I studied English, American literature. Currently I'm unemployed. My most recent job was as a tutor. Before that I've been a grant writer, payroll clerk. I've had like an assortment of jobs. C That sucks. It can be tough to find a good job these days. B Yeah, I agree. I agree. What's my dream job? I'd like to be an editor. I'd like to like edit publications or like write stories, Stories for publications. I feel more comfortable being an editor. I feel more comfortable like working with prose than with, I guess, like producing my own though. So I like to be like a publications editor. C Really? B Yeah, yeah. Travel a lot. I'd like to travel. I've traveled before. One of my most memorable experiences. I. C How close are you to your family? B I'm pretty close to my family. I moved back out here to be closer to them about two years ago from Chicago. And so I'm closer to them now. But I don't know, it was kind of a mistake professionally because I haven't been able to get anything going out here and so I probably should have stayed in Chicago. C Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Say again? I'm sorry, I don't really understand. C Tell me more about that. B I'm afraid I. Well, Chicago, it was fun over there. I was working As a grant writer. And I went there for grad school, but I ended up dropping out of grad school, but finding work and staying there for five years, I liked it a lot. C How do you like your living situation? B My living situation? I'm okay with it. Right now. I'm living with a relative. It could be better, but right now it's like. Right now I'm unemployed, and it's like letting me save, earn free. And so I'm okay right now with where I'm at, but I really, really do need to find another job so I can get myself stabilized. Yeah, I'm living with my uncle, and, you know, like I say, it's his place, and so he's kind of eccentric. I don't know how else to describe him. He's pretty out there, but anyway, he's an okay guy. C Have you ever served in the military? B Do I have a source of what? I'm sorry, Do I have a. I can really barely hear what you're saying, and it's hard for me to understand you sometimes, but I'll wait for you to answer me again or to say, ask me the question. C Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No, I haven't. C Okay. Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No, I haven't, but I've often felt depressed, but I've never had a diagnosis of depression. C Okay. How have you been feeling lately? B I've been feeling good lately. I mean, relatively. I mean. I mean, apart from being unemployed and feeling, like, really angsty over that, it's, you know, I'm in a position where I can, you know. You know, I can't sort of, like, survive out here, which is important. And, you know, I'm not homeless, which is important. So I feel okay. I mean, yeah, I could be doing a lot better. On the other hand, I'm not on the streets, and things could be much worse. C That's good. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B No, I haven't. C Can you tell me about that? B I'm not sure what the. The question was. I thought you said some kind of therapy. I've been in therapy before, but it hasn't. I don't know. I was mostly therapy to, like, the therapist, and I wasn't, like, really. It didn't really help me out so much. I guess, like, work out my issues. But I enjoy talking to the therapist, and I guess that's kind of like a parallel situation to this scenario, talking to a virtual human. You just have someone to sit with for a while who Will listen to you. It can be very soothing especially have a pleasant personality. C Do you feel that way often? B Do I feel that way often? Well, do I feel like I need to talk to someone very often? Sometimes. I mean, yeah, I do like repress emotions like meaning pretty much. I assume like if I were ever to become like close with someone, I would have someone I can share my, my thoughts and feelings with. But. And it's like, I guess you can say I do feel. What's the word? I feel lonely. But. Or not not lonely but I'm sort of like very self contained within. What's the word? Within my own sort of sense of self, my own feelings and I don't really have a need to reach out as much because I'm a pract God. I practice meditation and I sort of, it sort of helps me like like sort of retreat into myself and like sort of like find, find serenity, A sense of. A sense of serenity. Serenity through a lack of desire. And so that helps me with, I mean, I guess like loneliness but also, I mean maybe it also causes like you know, like a problem and that you know, I actually don't reach out to people as often as I, as I should and I've definitely neglected relationships because of that. And it may all be like self centeredness, you know, but I'm trying to. Yeah, it's just like I want to try to find a way to like engage with people without like really allowing myself to let them down, so to speak. And so that is one of the things that inhibits me from reaching out to people is the idea that I could potentially let them down if they were to place their faith in me or their trust in me. And so I'm very reluctant to do that. Go on. C How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B How easy it is for me? I don't really. Again, I'm only hearing part of what you're saying and so this is going to throw off my answer. I would say it's very easy. I mean I can't really, I don't really understand the question, but go on. C What are you like when you don't sleep well? B What I think instead of what am I most afraid of? Probably most afraid of ah, God. Being a failure or not being a success. Not finding a stable job, not being able to, I mean settle down, essentially get married. It's. I don't know, I'm okay with being single, I'm not okay with being jobless. And so it's like, one of those things. It's just like, I just. I don't feel I can reach out to people also because I don't have a job. And it's like, I don't want to, like, bring them into my. To make my life sort of right. Right now. I'm not in a position to, like, have people. I mean, to have a lot of friends, so to speak, because I can't, like, really go out and I can't, you know, spend money at. In restaurants or in clubs or whatever. So I'm on a bicycle a lot, and I. I think a lot. I meditate a lot and I. I read a lot of literature. C When was the last time you felt really happy? B When was the last time I felt really happy? Well, just last weekend I was at my. My aunt and uncle's 50th wedding anniversary. And it was a nice occasion. It was a really. It was. Their whole family was there. Our family was there. And it's like my own parents, 50th anniversary is coming up. 50, 50 years together. And I felt really happy for them. I felt really happy that I guess both of them had provided us with like, a really. A really great childhood. And it seems strange, I guess, like, with that kind of starting point, like that's. I mean. I mean, to, Yeah, I guess, like to be floundering right now. But I felt happy for them, I think. I guess occasions like that are probably gonna become rarer on a societal level, but that's sort of like beyond my own sort of, like, realm of happiness. Anyway, it's a good one. But, yeah, I feel happy this weekend that my aunt and uncle. 50th wedding anniversary. Other than that, I usually feel happy when I'm on the road on a bicycle and I'm going pretty fast. C Nice. How would your best friend describe you? B My best friend, actually, she would describe me as depressed all the time. And I asked her about this because I asked her if being around me had brought her down at all because she was going through her own very deep depression. And I was kind of trying to, like, coax her out of that, but at the same time I was gonna depress myself. And so I asked her if being around me brought her down at all. And she said no, it's. It made her. I mean, it made her feel happy that I. That I. That I had, like. That I'd taken an interest in her. But. What's the word that sort of like my. Sort of, like, my depression wasn't, like, really didn't have anything to do with her depression. It was. Her depression was, like, completely unrelated to, like, how I felt. And so, like, I don't know, in both our cases, it was just good to have someone else to be around who had some respect for, I guess, like, how we felt or, like, our mutual sort of, like, lack of feeling, if I can put it that way. And so, yeah, that's how she would describe me. I mean, as seeming very depressed all the time. And she was my best friend at this moment. C Is there anything you regret? B Anything I regret? All right, thank you. Goodbye. Hello. Bye. Bye. Hello. A How's it going? B It was kind of interesting. It's like, I should have. I told you I had, like. My ears are kind of. They're kind of clogged. And so I had trouble, like, hearing her at some point. At some points. I'm sorry. A You can take the microphone. B Okay. But I tried to, like, answer it. A Yeah. C So you can take your number up if you want. Oh, yeah.

R I see what you mean. I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B I got out of the country several times. What do you like in travel? B See new places. To I would love to hear about one of your trips. B When I was 14, I went to Costa Rica to visit my father and I was there for two weeks and it was the last time I went there. A beautiful. B What is one of your most memorable experiences in Costa Rica? Seeing my father for the first time in a few years was definitely a shock. How did you feel at that time? B um, joy.

Sometimes I lose it. I scream when I lose my cool and I put holes in the walls. Did that cause you to trouble? B not yet. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone? And what was it? B last night? My mother and I had an argument. It was a question of buying a ticket last night for a greyhound to go to Utah. What decided you to do this?

A Tell Me on your relationship with your family. B my little sister with which I am very close. She is 15 years old. She is about to be 16 in a few days. I would do anything for her.

B I learned the adaptation skills, so I am able to calm down when I am more angry. I know how to stay away from me, my trigger points. And get away from staying angry or becoming depressed. This can be if the person is willing to change and want it. R I see what you mean. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B 2 days ago. Can you tell me?

"A good, thank you. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. A good. B please, don't hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? Yes, I am. B ok. So how are you today? A I am fine, thank you. B is good. Where do you come from? Originally from Los Angeles and my parents are from Central America. B really? A yes. B What are the things you really like at the? Has time. I like me to get to water if I want, hills or hiking or just any element I want to go, I can get there. B What are the things you don't really like at it? Traffic, agitation. Everyone is always in a hurry. That's almost everything. B I see what you mean. I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? When I can. I have family in Central America when I can. My husband and I are trying to go to hot places like Mexico or somewhere in the Caribbean. B well. What do you like on travel? To the freedom not to have to have my daily routine and not to be guilty not to do something that I said that I would do. If I'm at home, and if I'm too far from home to do it, I have nothing to fear. B I would love to hear about one of your trips. One recently, I went back to Honduras. This is where my family comes from. So it's a bit like one. It is a double fold. I can see my family, but I am so far from home. So I do it by not imposing them. I visit them, but I stay in a hotel. So, in this way, I can still have my freedom and not have the impression of being forced to be with them. It is therefore more fun this way. B who makes sense. What is one of your most memorable experiences? Experiences on vacation or a most memorable experience? Probably Hawaii and Lahaina. And just have. I love food, I am a gourmet, so have the roast pig underground and eat it in this way, I have never been able to taste it in this way at any time. It is therefore like a very memory. It is a deep memory for me because it doesn't matter what I do on my pork, it will never have tasted that. Pork in Lahaina. B awesome. What have you studied at school? A business. And it was years ago, so I found myself in the field of marketing. So I appreciated my trade history. Helped me in the field of marketing. B what Is your dream work? Dream work? Hmm. Well, I guess it would have to do with food. I love to cook and the only reason I hesitate is because I like to cook, but I do it right for the house and friends and family. If I had to transform myself. If he had to transform himself into a job, I have the impression that it would not be as happy or if I would not have as much pleasure as I have it, you know, as I have it now. But if I could do it like a job and I always have the pleasure and the joy I have in cooking every day now, it would be my dream work. B yeah. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A I am out. B Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the aquarium. Screen saving. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. A it's cool. B What are you doing to relax? R depends on where I am, if I am where I am. In fact, the first thing I do is just to grasp me. In this way, I always control, it doesn't matter where I stand and always say that I am my own peace. P E A C E so I just take a deep inspiration, assess my situation, determine what I can control, what I cannot control, then proceed from there. But just in a way in a way to breathe and put my hand first. B How are you going to control your temperament? R I am really very good. I am actually very soft to start. I don't let anything worsen. And so if I just feel to become hot or if I react, I'm just as I said, just do my own little self-truth check. You know, I might have done a blow, I might have died for a second, but I do my own little check and say just, what do you know? Come on, it's not worth it. This person is not worth it. This situation is not worth it. Be who you are and stay there. B when will you go back the last time you argue with someone? In fact, it was with my husband and we went back and forth on my relationship with my father and I tried to give him a point and it was fair to neglect my feelings. And I didn't want him to neglect my feelings and act as if I did not feel what I felt. So I continued to stress my point in different ways. And then I found myself now in a debate. And then it was then that I retired and said no, look, baby, that's what I feel about this subject. I don't ask you to be felt differently. I just ask you to recognize my feelings. B How did you feel at that time? When I got to my own conclusion, I felt triumphant because the point of t The argument in my mind was to clarify what I felt, not for him to impose his own, you know, he is very macho, a little virile. I didn't want him to overshadow my feelings with his logic. And so I said no, as long as I felt better because I felt understood and I felt heard. B tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. A hmm, let's see. My son comes to my mind. He is 22 years old and we have a very strange relationship at the moment. And that's fine. I agree with that. He is used to being a little more needy, so I think he assumed that I would always go to seek or call him rather than wait for him to call me. And I think it may be a very weird answer, but I wish at the start of my life as a mother, I would have somehow adapted that so that it is not so comfortable waiting for me to be the only one to come and check it. He doesn't live with me, he has his own place. But while waiting for me to be the only one to come and get it and, you know, try to make sure it is fine. I think it's probably much more ethereal than you wanted, but I would have done it differently. I would have reached him differently along the way and I released him at an earlier age, which means that I have treated him more than one adult and that I did not expect that he is just somehow, you know, I would have killed the expectation in him so that I bypass him, if it made sense. B do you find easy to be a parent? One no is not easy. You must sacrifice. And beyond physical things, you just have to make sure you put your children's needs before yours. And I guess the second part of this answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they are fine, you are fine. So my son, my daughter, they both know that I love them unconditionally. So my parenting became easier, the more and more and more I lived in this truth. Where I am not expecting anything of them, but I don't expect a lack of respect either. So, as long as we have this clear communication line, everything that is happening with others is this category of respect. B is good. What is the most difficult thing to be a parent? Perhaps see decisions I want them to make. It could be as simple as a choice of outfit or as much as a career change, but having to sit down, watch them listen, to be open, and to be just there, you know, if they want to talk about it, but not trying not to manage them, because I was also their age and I must re member that I didn't want to be managed. And even if I made a mistake, I didn't want to be tried. So the difficult part is to look at them simply go through the process by themselves and in a way, in a way pending. Fortunately, it's nothing major with my children. But whatever this personal fall, it's just to be there and not to have and I told you, I told you so much spirit on me. B What is the best thing to be a parent? To be satisfactory knowing that, you know, I created this. You know, I planned my two children. So that's right. It's a real one. It was an honor that I was able to do. It is an honor that they are in good health and it is fun to look at them somehow sort of growing. And it's like they were mini me, but then they are also different from me. And so it is fun to be able to allow them to be who they are and to celebrate them simply as they are. So I appreciate that. B What are the ways that you are different as a parent than your parents? A wow. Completely. My parents immigrated here from Central America in the 1960s. I was born the year after their arrival. Their mentality was therefore different. They wanted to come and get the American lifestyle, which was not a bad thing. It's just that their parental style was more likely to make sure that we had a house, to make sure that we had the shelter, of course, food and clothing and schooling. But there was not really much time spent on my mother's relationship to my daughter as a girl, nor my father for me as a girl. So I had to understand it for myself when it came to being a parent. B tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. A divorce from my first husband because I was going to be the one who overthrew all this situation was a good father, but not a good husband for me. Band. R and after 20 years, I knew that I was going to be the only one to say, it no longer works for me. And since I did it, the domino effect was, it's not virtual. It happened. We ended up selling our house, dividing the active ingredients, then living separately. And then my children were a bit between the two for a while. And then I just made decisions where I did not want to pass as many court hassles. So I just made a Tina Turner and I said: Just give me my name, you keep everything else. So it was just a very difficult decision by the way it affected my children. That's all I was concerned in terms of loss of all physical and all the material. I don't care. But It was hard because I knew it was going to affect my children. And they were the only thing that worried. B What has decided to do this? To my husband and I do not, you know, given the eyes on certain things concerning our marriage. I did not feel validated as a woman or as a wife. And it's just who I am. And these are the very areas in which it did not validate me. He just saw me as a partner who helped finance his parascolia, whether just a trip or anything. I'm not here to talk about this part. The main thing is that everything he did was outside the holiness of our house. And I was tired of working and benefiting from everything, but not being accomplished as a woman or a woman. And he was not ready to change, despite all the advice he followed. And I thought, well, it does not work for me and I must first take care of myself. And I had low self -esteem. You know, I was not perfect. I had a lot with myself. And I had to learn to love me so that I love my children. And then so that I can get the love I should get back. B How easy for you to have a good night's sleep? What do you know? It is actually quite easy because in the end, I know just, good, bad, ugly or indifferent, whatever the errors I made that day, or anything good that day. My goal in life is just to have peace of mind. So when I lowered my head at night, I'm just. I wonder, you know, did I do everything I am ashamed today? Did I go through someone I didn't do? You know, and I am not moralizing or does not act as if I am Pollyanna, but I believe in Karma. I am a woman fearing God. So I just want to make sure I did everything I had to do today. And if there is something that I can rectify, you know, I just make a duty to promise myself to go back and to rectify it or at least learn about it and simply not make this same mistake in another day. B How have you been feeling lately? A really good. Light, you know, had raw patches with the family individually. As I said with my son. My daughter is a teenager, so she comes in a way. It is therefore a different relationship. She is in front of me. I am actually very easy to live, very bohemian. She is very social, very, you know, right there. So I just have to find our balance. But overall, that's right, I will not complain. I am very happy for A very simplistic lifestyle that I promote a little every day. And I just appreciate my small mini-productions, whether someone sees them or not. B ok. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? No, I didn't do it, thank God. B Have you received a diagnosis of depression? A number B tells me about the last time you felt really happy. A really happy. Let's see. It's at home. And I think it was when different things that cross my head. I think that when my daughter and I, my adolescent daughter and I learned to understand our mother's relationship. I don't try to be her best friend, but that doesn't mean she can't talk to me. And I think that when she came to me the other day and made me a little hug behind me without really saying anything, I really felt her. And she accepted the fact that I accept who she is as she is. So it was a very docile moment. Only she and I knew it in a way, but it just gave me a happiness that nothing else could ever give me. B It's so good to hear. A thank you. B How would your best friend describe you? A I am easy to live. I'm fun. I'm just very, you know, a chameleon comes to my mind. I just acclicit the situation in which I am. I am very honest. I am very real and just, you know, daring if I have to be. I'm just very adult. I am an adult woman. And, you know, they would simply describe that my best friend would describe me as someone she can count, extremely reliable. I do as I say, I say what I do. And I'm just, you know, I don't do it. I don't take care of BS. B What are the things you want to be able to change about you? An HMM, what can I change from me? Probably cosmetic things. Maybe I would do it. This is not even true. Let me think. What things would I change in myself? It sounds weird that I wouldn't say anything, really. I think I would be a little more aware of the others. I think. I'm sorry, super sensitive to others, but I think I would be more aware, make sure that I am not selfish or that I am not adjusting anyone simply because I want to pass my yoga or that I want to do something else. I think I would just be more attentive and aware of those around me to make sure that I do not offend anyone. B is there something you regret? R I have no regrets. I think about it all the time. And, you know, it is natural to go back and to say that if I was in this situation, with the state of mind I have now, what would I do? But the reality is that I know everything The hat has arrived so far shaped me. So I cannot very well take advantage of it, then turn around and call it a regret because I know that I learned. It probably seems very manual, but it's true. This is really how I live. So I believe that everything that is good, bad, ugly or indifferent has happened for a reason. I really believe that. And my work is to withdraw what I am supposed to withdraw and take this in my future. So I have to take the hard blows with the joys. B I understand. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A real being with myself. This is something that took me 20 years old to happen just to be honest with myself, to kiss who I am, for, you know, to know who I am, to learn my own infrastructure, to be comfortable with the. With the innate things that are part of me. Do not try a re. Do not try to reorganize or try to become something that I am not. I would still have chosen the same marketing career. I would have climbed the same corporate ladders again, but I would have done it from an internal place. Not that I got lost in it, but in terms of my family life, I would have just been more faithful to myself. And in this way, I would not have had any feelings. B What are you the most proud in your life? To my family, my role as a wife, my role as a mother. I think that in the end, this is where my main accomplishment comes from because no matter, at the end of this life, this life in this body, in this rented vehicle in which I am, all that I am going to do or all that I am going to be is an epitaph somewhere in a cemetery. And I'm always true to that. I mean that I have always been faithful to that for 18 years and I realized that I wanted to be married and have a family and children and all that. I think that in the end, this is where my real accomplishment comes from. B ok. I think I asked for everything I need. A fee. B Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. A thank you. B Goodbye. A bye. It's great. It's great. B I will therefore stop recording and make you all here.

She'll let you know and then when she says goodbye, you can go ahead and hit that doorbell and let me know that you're all done. B Okay? A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to. B Yes? A little nervous. This is different. California? Yes. A What are some things you really like about la? B I like the beach, the weather, some of the people. Yeah. A What do you do now? B What do you mean, what do I do now? A What's your dream job? B I don't know right now. I went through nursing. A Are you happy you did that? B Yes. A Are you still working at that? B No. Tell me more about that, about nursing. That's a great feel to be in if you have the heart, the passion for caring for people. My mother. Yeah. How close are you right now? We're close. I have pretty close family. A That's good. Do you consider yourself an introvert? B What do you mean? A Why don't we talk about that later? B Okay. A What do you do to relax? B I like to read and I like watching some television. I think I'm very good at controlling it. I. I can't remember the last time I had an argument. I'm not for sure what I do when I'm really annoyed. I think I get, I don't know, walk a lot. I'm not for sure when I'm annoyed. I have different reactions to whatever's annoyed me. A What are some things that make you really mad? B Make me mad? Mad is a hell of a Word for me to be mad. It means like when I'm mad. It's uncontrollable when I'm mad. Mm. A How would your best friend describe you? B I don't have a best friend. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I don't really know. Now, my mother. Mm. A Could you say a little more about that? B About my mother? My mother was a beautiful woman and she had great values instilled in us. When. In raising me. Yeah. A Can you give me an example of that? B Values? Well, good. One thing is, like, my mother cooked, and that was a valuable thing to me because she taught me to cook. So that was very valuable. Honesty. A That's great. B Mm. About my mother. When she's no longer living. Excuse me. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior? Constantly. B Changed in my behavior since I've been here. I don't. I think a little uncomfortable. Yeah. It's a little strange how I've been feeling lately. A little uneasy because of my experience. The things I went through. Been going through. I was raped and sodomized and they kept a gun to my head and cut my hair. So I've been going through a hell of a thing lately. A That sounds really hard. B Yes, it is. A How do you cope with that? B I cope. It's difficult, but I do cope. It's not easy for me to sleep, to get a good night's sleep. Excuse me. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B I don't know. Maybe sluggish, maybe. Sometimes I can be more irritable when I don't sleep well. I don't sleep well that often. Yes, that's what I have been diagnosed with a few years ago. A What got you to seek help? B Cause I wanted to get revenge on the guys that raped me? No. But I'm gonna go back. Excuse me. I thought I was better. I. I knew I had a problem, but I didn't know what it was. As far as what? I didn't sleep. I didn't eat. I had nightmares. I still have them. I was real afraid of. I'm really afraid. I was not afraid. A Do you have disturbing thoughts? B As far as what? Disturbing thoughts. Like what? Of the things that's happened to me, those are disturbing thoughts. Sometimes if I see four men together with hoods on is I have it triggered by that. Sometimes when I have to go upstairs, it's a trigger because of the. Of what happened. They took me upstairs. Yes, ma'am. A Do you feel like therapy is useful? B Excuse me? A Do you feel like therapy is useful? B Therapy's what. A What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? B I haven't been to therapy for a while, but I've noticed how to calm myself down when I get afraid, and that's about it. A That's good. How has seeing your therapist affected you? B It helped a lot of things that happened in my past, I didn't realize that was deep down inside me still. A How have you been feeling lately? B Just. Just, you know, just day by day. Just making it, I think. A Okay. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? B Music. A That's great. B Yeah. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Cooking the other day. Cooking. A What are you most proud of in your life? B My son. I only have one son and he's a beautiful child. A Do you find it easy to be a parent? B No, it's not, I think decision making. A Can you give me an example of that? B Some of the things that he's asked, like, I'm not into tattoos. I don't like tattoos. And he does. And there's a lot of different things. A What's the best thing about being a parent? B Best thing about being a parent? Giving life and seeing them grow up, enjoy in their lives. That's going on. That's a good thing. No, I don't really know. I really don't know. As far as what my memorable experience, I could say when graduating was a good experience. Yes. Great. When I graduated, Great. To graduate from high school wasn't hard. No, it wasn't hard. I enjoyed school. A That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? B I don't remember. Bye. Wow, this is deep. This is deep.

"A Okay, looks like we're good, but let's move around a little bit. Make sure that the connector is picking you up, all right? It's taking its time. Okay, great. And then if you don't mind, can I ask you to just place yourself on either floor? Okay, great. Okay, I win. This is all done. She'll let you know. And then if you want to hit this doorbell again to let me know. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? Fine. That's good. Where are you from originally? B Colorado. A Really? Why'd you move to la? B Career. Career possibilities. A What do you do now? B Paralegal. A Awesome. When did you move to la? B For further education. For the weather? For a friend. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B Not often at all now? Every few years. A What are some things you really like about la? B The weather, the beach, sunsets at the beach. A lot of career possibilities. Educated group of people, sophisticated market. A How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B It is an adjustment to come here. A lot of people misjudge it a little bit. It's a laid back, appearing town, but it's actually very sensitive to, you know, success and commercialization and that kind of thing. So you have to keep up the pace. A Yeah. How hard is that? B That is a little bit harder. I think when you first make the adjustment and pretty soon it becomes obvious that it's another market that you just have to work hard in like you do in others. A That makes sense. What's your dream job? B Oh, an attorney. A Really? Why? B Oh, just because you have the power. You can use skills to be able to affect people's lives in a more dramatic way than just being an assistant in that field. A Cool. How close are you to your family? B Oh, a lot of it is not around anymore just to have brothers and sisters out of state. So not particularly close right now. A I'm sorry, what are some things that make you really mad? B Dishonesty, unkindness, lack of sympathy, insensitivity, you know? A Yeah. How are you at controlling your temper? B Very good. If anything, I'm regressive that way. A That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Oh, wow. B Oh, just a friend. A friend who is right now has a fabulous job but is spending too much money that he needs to save. Uh. A Oh. How do you know them? B Through a work situation. Just a work connection. A How close are you to them? B Close. Close. Now we spend time we have. We go out and have fun sometimes. A That's good. What are some things you like to do for fun? B A walk, walking the beach. You know, shop in the beach areas, is kind of on Rodeo Drive occasionally. And see films, art galleries. A Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Oh, my daughter. A Aw. Tell me about your kids. B I just have one daughter who graduated UCLA Law School and I raised her totally alone without any help, so it seemed like an ab accomplishment that was worth it. The two jobs and the work just. I say peer pressure. It can totally alter anything a parent is trying to put into a child. It's good. A Yeah. Can you give me an example of that? B Oh, wow. Yeah. My daughter, for being now at a graduate of law school when she was. We kept her in Beverly Hills schools and some of those very wealthy kids with very named celebrity families used to like shoplift. She actually got in trouble for that once and not because she was an influenced. So that was a really bad time for us. A That sounds really hard. What do you think of today's kids? B I think it depends on which neighborhood or state you're in or the. I think they're a little misguided, I think a little uninspired right now. I think they've been weighed down by the concerns of the wars and. And things like that. And I think they could probably use a common goal, a common, you knowity, as opposed to just being more separated group. Once they were, I think, you know, kind of uninspired right now. A Yeah, I see what you mean. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B I worry sometimes about, you know, work issues, but it's pretty, pretty easy. A Do you feel that way often? B No, I don't feel like I'm not sleeping. I just occasionally will worry about something. A Work. When was the last time that happened? B Oh, gosh, about a couple weeks ago. A How did you feel in that moment? B Just, you know, unfortunately we have to worry. Unfortunate. This isn't easier. It's just cooperation between people. It solves most everything, you know, so you always want to have that around you. A What are you like when you don't sleep? B Well, just stressed. Yeah, stressed. A More stressed. That sounds really Hard. Do you feel down? B Fatigue has a lot of implications for just sleep, not feeling like yourself or misjudging things that you might judge differently if you were more arrested. A Yeah. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Not depression. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? Probably. B That was considered the possibility. I had an employment lawsuit several years ago and actually litigated it and won a sense settlement, something a whistleblower thing, implications of that. And I was kind of harassed about it. And so I found when I got out of it, I couldn't find work right away in my field. So I had to go into a different field, go back to UCLA and get a new professional direction. And I found myself fearful sometimes that it's going to happen again. You know, anything like that would happen again. No. A I'm sorry to hear that. What got you to seek help? B Just that I was noticing that. I was noticing that I was feeling very. In my paralegal class, I had a section about employment law and there was a very complicated filing I had done with great deal of work and study for my case. But once faced with it again in that class setting, I just couldn't get it done. It was late. It was a late paper for me and I realized I was traumatized by having to go through that again. Post traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the adrenaline dies down, from what I understand. So I think it was just hitting me later that I was having to face that paper again. And wow, no adrenaline, just like, wow, there it is again. A What were your symptoms? B Just extreme avoidance of getting something done. That should have been easy for me. And three, thinking about it as thoroughly as I should, over studying it or putting it off, putting the feeling of going through that paper, that type of paper, even if it's just a class assignment again. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B Well, not lately, you know, back then for sure, when that happened, which was about 10 years ago now, it was settled in court about 7 years ago now. And yeah, yeah, it was effective. It was effective in the way you view most everything in your confidence and. A That kind of thing. Do you feel like therapy is useful? B I'm sorry, repeat the question. A Do you feel like therapy is useful? B Peaceful. Do I feel peaceful? Well, yeah, I was peaceful that it was settled, but angry that it ever happened. So it's hard to all probably not ever feel peaceful about that issue, ever. It always. The mention of it always makes me angry that I had to go through that. A Yeah. Could you have done anything to avoid it? B I don't Think so I tried everything to avoid it, you know, and so I think that was aggravating for me too because I'm a patient person, realistic, and I tried everything to avoid confrontation, no matter. But it was just required to try to help me cover the damage to our lives and we daughter's life. A Yeah. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Not now. B Maybe one time in my life. Not now. If you can't communicate, you know, if you can communicate, you can overcome people's perceptions and their judgments of you. If you can effectively explain something and it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself that others might normally have judgments for age or anything like that. A Yeah. What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Just raising a daughter extendedly, you know, or, you know, just the experience of thinking that was after all the years that was a success. Her graduate from law school. A Yeah. How did you feel in that moment? B Just like a lot of work had a good ending, you know, happy. Glad that it was fulfilled. Wishes or dreams for this child were fulfilled, you know, and she was able to make that success. A That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? B Wow. I tend to be kind of happy with life because the alternative is going to harm your ability to succeed. So I try to force happiness, I guess, in most every situation in my life. Find something about it. When I lost some weight recently that made me really happy. A Wow, that's great. Do you travel a lot? B I travel a little bit locally. I traveled more when I was younger. I really enjoyed that, but I've just been too busy in the last few years. A Yeah. What do you enjoy about traveling? B Just new places. Ability to take the worries we have every day, work or concerns and kind of put them away for a while and see something new. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B We're back to Colorado several years ago. Went through bail and spent the night there. And it was just during spring where there aren't many skiers. And it was just beautiful and very quiet. A lot of restaurants with the decks and open in the mountains and it was beautiful. A That sounds like a great situation. How would your best friend describe you? Wow. B Just ardent, hardworking, loyal, creative. A Okay. What's the best thing about being a parent? B Just seeing something that you're creating, you're trying to create becomes something that you hoped the picture would be. You know, if that's the case, you know, it's just a hard work fulfilled or presented itself in a certain way that, you know, it makes you happy. A Yeah. How close are you to them? B To my daughter? Pretty close. She just had a baby. She's in the Bay Area. She sends me pictures all the time. A Aw, that's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Goodbye. Bye. B Those are so cool. A Yeah. Okay, cool.

"A good, it looks great. Okay, so again, when she has finished, she will say goodbye. Just press this button and I will come back. B agree. A thank you. Hi. Hi. I am Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. A it's good. Where do you come from? B I was born in Oakland. A really? What are the things you really like? B All different areas of the city, the different cultures that are here. What are the things you don't really like at it? B Traffic, lack of public transport and superficiality. R I see what you mean. I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. B do you travel a lot? I don't know. I would love to travel more. What do you like in travel? B UM, being able to live a different lifestyle. Get out of the bubble in which you normally live and obtain a different perspective. To I would love to hear about one of your trips. B in 2008, I studied abroad in Brazil, and it was about four months. And I was in Bahia, who is in the North, and the program consisted in learning history, learning the language and staying with a host family. A beautiful. What decided you to do this? B I have always wanted to travel and I chose Brazil because they have an Afro Brazilian population or a large Afro Brazilian population, which I really wanted to know more. And I think history and culture are really interesting. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B I think that taking a bus by myself to an isolated beach and simply navigating alone and understanding where to go. Yeah, it's great. What did you study at school? B at the moment, I receive my master in social work. What is your dream work? B Dream Job? I think I consult mental health and how. How to intervene effectively with different cultures and carry out research and consultation and travel work, fundamentally, it would be the main characteristics. A good. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I think it's a false dichotomy, but I consider myself shy, but at the same time coming out in the sense that I push myself to do things Outside my comfort zone. And I am determined to do what it takes to succeed. Who makes sense. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I listen to music and I went down on my bed and I guess you could say mind consciousness and really detach me from things. Breathing exercises also, which I learn more as well as exercise. How are you going to control your temperament? B pretty well. I don't get angry much, so when it comes to angry temperament, I am quite good in this area. A it's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B hmm, umm. What month is it? May, probably two months ago. And I argued by SMS. So, it's not really intense, but I guess you would call it in one way to find out whether or not I should be forgiven for something I thought was a minor. With a friend I have had for a few years, I felt anxious, sad and angry. Yeah, these are the main emotions. How do you know them? B I know them because I think I am quite in touch with my emotions and that I can identify them. And then I will notice the physical manifestations of emotions, as if my heart beats or if I sweat. If my breathing is more superficial, I will know that I am anxious. I will know that something bothers me. To tell me about a situation you want to manage differently.

My fault. Okay, now we're ready to go. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A I am. B Okay. So how are you doing today? A I feel pretty good. I'm wide awake. I had a good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee and I have an easy day today. So I am just going to chat with you. Then I am going to the gym and run some errands, so. So I plan on having a nice day today. I was born and raised in Los Angeles and I'm one of the few locals from around here. I went to school away, but I'm one of the few natives that are actually in Los Angeles. B Really? A Yes, I am. B What are the things you really like about la? A I like the weather. Having owned a vacation house in another state that I found to be too hot and humid in Florida. I love the weather here. I like the culture, I like the diversity, I like the familiarity, I like that the beaches. But I also like that just an hour and a half away one can go to the desert, say Palm Springs, Palm Desert, but also another hour and a half, two hours away, you can go to Arrowhead or Big Bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that. And I think it's a great place to live. B I see what you mean. A Thank you. B What are some things you don't really like about la? A Well, more maybe some of the things I don't like about LA or say California in general, say like the high tax rate, which the state tax rate is up to 13 point something now, which is going to chase business out of here. Also the regulations. I'm a small business owner, so all the regulations are clearly affecting business. So many of my peers have moved their businesses to Texas, Arizona, Nevada, etc. Some of the other western states that are less regulated, that's a big problem here. California, it really does. Most people don't understand it, but it's also, you know, besides the high taxes, you know, there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here, most people don't see that. But it's a big tax on the social service system and that's what makes our taxes so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of. So that's, you know, but people don't seem to want to really deal with, deal with that. But it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things, that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state. B I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? A I enjoy traveling. I've been to 66 countries and I don't travel as much as I used to, but I've traveled quite a bit and I've learned a couple of languages and I surf. I'm sorry, I didn't really understand your question when you said like what? I don't think you understood what I said, but I'll just go back and I've been all through Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, South America, North Africa and I enjoy that. I enjoy warm climates now, especially where you can go and relax where it's warm water to surf because the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up. I also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and I try to eat healthy and That's a big part of my life. B I'd love to hear about one of your trips. A Oh sure. One of my favorite trips of all time was I used to, when I was younger, see how many countries I can do in a relatively short period of time, say in a three or four week span. But about 10 years ago we actually went to Paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city. Even though I've been there about 10 times. We got to know the city really well, which was great. Really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping. But really having been there so many times, really never stayed for more than three or four days. It was fun to stay there for about almost a month and really get to learn the city. It was fun even though I grew up in la. I grew up taking French, which there wasn't a big Spanish speaking population when I when I was younger. So my mother insisted that all of us kids take French, even though Spanish would have been a lot more valuable. But I took French all through elementary, junior high and high school, so it was nice to practice my French even though I don't remember a whole lot and even though I was speaking French with the French, you know, my accent isn't the greatest. So after a couple of sentences they, they start talking English to me. What did you study at school? I have a few different degrees. I was a naval science major as an undergraduate and that was fun. I also have a master's degree in economics and I have a degree in crisis management. B What made you decide to do that? A I found them interesting and it was something that I wanted to do. Where I went to college. I went to the Naval Academy. I went there to play sports and I found it real interesting being from Southern California, going to school in Maryland. I originally went to be a doctor, but once you start going to school for a little bit, you change your mind, et cetera. B Are you still working in that? A I'm actually in the wholesale business now. We're wholesale distributors of furniture products and it was a family business but I went to work there a number of years ago when my grandfather recently father passed away. So I sort of run up 80 year old family business and it's pretty interesting. I like it having grown up around it, but it's different than other jobs I've had in the past. B What's your dream job? A Actually probably my dream job. I think this is fun. I've changed so much. I enjoy cooking and staying at home and I would probably like to stay home and raise kids. I do have one daughter and didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as I would have liked. But I think I would be better than say a lot of women I know that want to work. I actually like cooking and hanging out around the house and taking care of kids that I like doing and always on a part time basis. But it seems like boy, that would be fun to stay home and do that. Having pretty much worked for most of my life, so it'll probably never happen. But it sounds something that to me would be fun. B Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A I think I am generally more reserved and shy with strangers. But when I get to know someone or feel comfortable, I think I'm more of an extrovert. Whereas more strangers might think I'm more introverted. But I think when I feel comfortable with certain people and I don't know what it is, I can meet a stranger and be totally confident or people I might have known for years either from a personal or business situation and be more introverted. I just go with the dynamics. But I think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy. Generally I like to use the term reserved. B Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? A Oh wow, that's a great idea. I used to have that on one of my. I have several computers at home and that used to be one of my screensavers as well. I usually tend when I need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events, I usually find exercise, whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach, maybe going surfing or the weather is warm. I don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes. It gives me like a brain freeze. Even though I've surfed for over 30 years, I usually find exercise helps me relax the best. Or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the TV I find very relaxing. But I like that screensaver. I used to have that on one of my screensavers at home. B That's great. A Yes, that was it. But that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though, my relaxation skills. I probably didn't have them the best in my 20s, but over the years I think I've gotten better at them. I Think that's a key thing. And I think as we mature, as we learn how to do that, I wish I learned how to do that and be a little more. Hadn't had those skills earlier. B How are you at controlling your temper? A I like to think I'm pretty good. I think I'm a lot better as well as that as I've aged. You know, I am more likely to think before I speak now, whereas say 20 years ago I was more likely to act before I thought so might have said more things that I in a whatever tense situation, whether it be personal or a work situation. But I've never had a violent temper. But I would have a temper where I fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and really reflecting on it. I think I'm a lot better at that now than I was say in my teens or twenties. So I think a lot of that comes. I think the key word there is maturity. B When was the last time you argued with someone? A Oh, wow. You know, I haven't really had an argument with anybody in several. What I would consider a traditional argument, probably my ex wife. A number of years ago we had an argument basically just over my daughter. It wasn't anything violent, but it was heated. Just basically one of the reasons we weren't married. Our values are so different. Just our ideas of parenting and just outlook on life was so different. I think that caused us to butt heads, but it was just. I don't know if I'd call it an argument, but it was more of just one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads. B How did you feel in that moment? A I felt like I was talking to a wall and I actually felt more mad at myself that I should have learned earlier in life that boy, before you get married with someone, have children with them, that's the kind of discussions that people should usually have. But you're not really thinking about that because sometimes when we're younger we're looking at boy, how does that. I look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me. But I'm pretty easygoing and I have different ideas on raising children how she did. And it was more not that she was wrong and I was right, not that I was right and she was wrong. It was just how we were raised and just different views and we never really discussed those things, but it was really just fundamental reasons on why we butted heads and weren't really a good match. Whereas other things looked good, you know, on paper to both of us. B Tell me about A situation that you wish you had handled differently. A Hmm. There's one recently. My father passed away recently. Thank you. And really, because in our religion, you plan a funeral very quickly, typically within a couple of days, and I really only invited very, very close friends and family members. I was more or less sort of in charge of it. My dad was remarried, but his widow was sort of not really up to it, So I took care of it. And I wish I invited a. I kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come to the service and been known about it. So I really only invited just because of the time pressure, really just a handful of people. But now, as time has passed, I wish I invited more of his friends Instead of just two or three close friends, 10 or 20 acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years, and even distant family members. I really just told after the fact. I really didn't invite them because I was under a time pressure, but I could have easily done it via email or. It's hard to call everybody personally, but I wish that's something people have expressed a little. They were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me. Oh, you didn't tell me until after the fact that so and so had passed. B So. A So they all threw it at me because I was more or less doing it. So I wish I did that differently, but I did the best I could at the time, so I'm not really mad at myself. That's something I probably should have been more prepared for also, because it was something that was coming, was inevitable. B I see. Tell me about your relationship with your family. A Well, both of my parents are recently deceased in the last couple of years, and I had a brother that I have three brothers, one of who passed away in December. And we're not super close. Like, I always. Like I look at other families, we were just never like that Norman Rockwell painting because we're all so different. And I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family. Not that it's strained, but I wish it was more like, boy, one of those families that got together Sunday and had dinner and all that. We just never did that because we're all also different. Yeah, it's. Yeah, just being. That's how it is. But, you know, to strangers, most people say, howdy, family. Everybody's great, but I think every family has their own sort of stuff. B Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? A No, but I thought probably I could have had it before from some other events in my life, and I just wasn't sure. I had been to some therapy in the past, just from, you know, I was in the military, and I was never really sure if that's exactly what it was, but I think I function pretty well. But I just wasn't sure that I had been to some therapy and counseling over the years. B Why did you decide to enlist in the military? A I didn't enlist. I was an officer. I went to one of the service academies. How did you when you joined the military? 17. I started one after high school and I went to a service academy. So it's more prestigious. Just isn't enlisting. It's the hard. Where I went, it's the hardest school in America to get into. B You were very young, weren't you? A I was about the same age as everybody else that went there. B Did you ever see combat? A We did. 1983. B Can you tell me about that? A Just basically, it wasn't anything intense. We were just around. We were just. We weren't allowed to carry ammunition. Our positions were just shelled at the time and poison gas was sprayed on us. So that was. It wasn't anything too intense. It was a lot. Because the service I was in, the training is way more intense than any actual combat situation. B Why? A That's because they train you well. It's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete, if you play football, you practice harder than you actually play in the game. The same with if you're in a combat unit. B How did serving in the military change you? A It made me more patriotic, having grown up in California, where people were from all over the country and I got to meet. Whereas most of, say, my friends who grew up in affluent Los Angeles like I did never really went out and met a lot of Americans and people from different backgrounds and ended up becoming just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country. Whereas you really don't grow up with that in Southern California. Whereas someone from Texas or Kentucky or Tennessee or Georgia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana grows up with that kind of pride. So I thought it was good. Unlike so many of my friends that they don't know there's any life between Malibu and Manhattan. B What did you do after the military? A I went to graduate. I was still in the reserves, but I went to graduate school and I got two graduate degrees and I went to work in private enterprise. Didn't care for it that I joined the fire department. I was a firefighter and paramedic for a Number of years. And then after I got divorced, it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter. So I went to work in a family business. That's pretty much my career in a nutshell. B How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? A At first it was difficult because I just had such a bearing on my butt from the way I walked, I talked. And again, I was an officer. You were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time. It was harder. It took me a while to be able to come back to Los Angeles because it was just so different. I think I handle it better than most. I have a stronger personality, but it was a great experience. B That's good. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? A It all depends. If I exercise regularly and I don't eat too late and things are going well in my life, I generally sleep pretty well. Even though I might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now. But I generally sleep. I generally sleep pretty well. B How have you been feeling lately? A I feel pretty good lately. You know, I've been like anybody else. More periods of blue in your life, but the last few months I feel great, pretty much. B Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? A No, not really. I think I seem a little happier, more content lately. B Okay. Have you been diagnosed with depression? A I thought maybe in the past because I do have a family history of it and you know, it wasn't anything real too debilitating that I wasn't able to really function on my own. But I was concerned with it and sought counseling. I do. I was really against it in the past and until after I went. I mean, I wish I went more, say during my marriage, over the course of my life now. I think it's very useful. However, in the past I was one of those. I grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous and it was a waste of money, etc. But I think it's a useful tool if you're open to it. B What got you to seek help? A Just some questions I wanted. Just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers, from a professional, you know, about life, relationships and sometimes it's good talking things out with a professional. Even though I wouldn't see somebody like you in real life. I prefer someone who's older than I am, a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger. B I understand. A So. But yeah, I think it's a useful tool and I really did a 180 degree switch on that. B Do you still go to therapy now? A I don't go now. I'm sort of taking a break from it. But I'm not against it. If I have some issues I want to bounce off, I do have someone that I can go to. B Okay. A Yeah. B How has seeing a therapist affected you? A I think it's nice. You know, they really. If you go to someone who's good. And again, I've been to a few different people I've sort of therapist shopped. They really don't tell you what to think, which I think is great. You know, that's always in the past. They just help you talk through your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself, but bring a little clarity to the situation. That's why I like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience. And I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than, say, to a man. But I think it's a useful tool. I got some good ideas and it's nice bouncing some things off. Totally. Someone who's unbiased and is not in your day to day life instead of talking to a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you. But sometimes bouncing people off a stranger is good. B Tell me about the last time you. A Felt really happy this morning. I know this is weird, but I'm clearly someone and I say this is a joke to my friends and family and associates. I clearly have. I'm having an easy day today because I knew we had nice weather and I had a bunch of errands turn on and I clearly have seasonal affective disorder, but I woke up so happy today when I know it's going to be 80 degrees out and when the weather is nice, I'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and cold where I always. I know that term. But I woke up really happy today because I know it's going to be a nice day and I look forward to feeling the sun. B How would your best friend describe you? A Most of my friends, I'm sort of a Renaissance man. I know a little bit about a lot of subjects. Too smart for my own good. And I'm. I know a lot about a lot of things. I'm pretty rational. I'm very resourceful. People always call me when they have issues and I help talk them through it or I'm resourceful and tell them where to go, whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or, you know, I'm great with medical diagnoses and you know, people also say I'm a lot of fun and fun to be with and I also have. I don't have a lot of gray areas. People either really like me or don't like me. With me, things are pretty much black and white. I am what I am. I don't bs. I'm the opposite of a politician. So I don't tell people what they want to hear. I don't be rude, not rude to anybody. But I pretty much call things as I see them. So that's pretty much no, not really. Because I do everything tactfully. B Okay. A I like to think I do. B Is there anything you regret? A I wish I probably spent more time with my parents before they passed, but I was busy. I probably wish I was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger, but just a lot of it's very typical. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A Really to think things through a little bit more, be a little less impulsive. I pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now. I think that's it. And I would look at things in the long term instead of looking at things in the short term. When you make decisions or choices. B What are you most proud of in your life? A I'm proud of my daughter. She's a nice young lady. I am proud of my public service. I've never done a job really for money. Of my military service and fire service. There are very few people like me who did it, who had the background in education that I did. But I like public service, so I'm proud of that. I'm proud of all the certificates that I have hanging on my walls at home in degrees, sort of like trophies. I'm proud that I've been able to stay in really good physical shape over the years and knock wood and maintain good health. B Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. A Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. It was nice meeting you. B Goodbye. A Bye bye. Thank you. How was I? Fantastic. B Oh, I'm sorry. A It's like those old fashioned, you know, like Ray Bans like this when you start the hooks in the back.

B I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. It. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? C Yes. B Okay. C I'm. B How are you doing today? C A little nervous, you know, not knowing what to expect, but I'm okay. What do you want? Pacific Northwest, Washington State? B Things you really like about LA. C Weather, the variety of things you can do and the variety of people and the Hollywood, the movie stars and stuff being around. It's very liberal, really, compared to a lot of places. B What are some things you don't really like about la? C Traffic is getting bigger and tonight's gonna be very impersonal. And, you know, when you meet people, you know, it takes a while to learn to trust them. Got a lot of players in la. B Do you travel a lot? C I used to. Not anymore. B What do you enjoy about traveling? C Well, when I did travel, I was. It was just to go somewhere else and be with a certain group of people to doing workshops and stuff. But now I don't like to. I wouldn't want to fly anymore because of all the restrictions and problems they've had since 9 11. B I'd like to hear about one of your trips. C Well, I flew out to. Well, I used to fly a lot out to San Francisco area and I was with a group of people reclaiming. We did rituals and workshops and I spent some time going a lot of workshops. We were outside, so I kind of like. We'd have a week of camping out and having little workshops and getting to know people from different parts of the country. Find out what's going on. B What's one of your most memorable experiences? C Finding out I had breast cancer, stage three. That was that one really? I had up 11 surgeries. The kinds of tumors. Breast cancers have come back, but I've had tumors. I've had 11 surgeries because of tumors. Tumors on my ovary, tumor on my kidney. I even had a. Something on my thyroid they had to take out. So it's been an experience. B That's great. What did you study at school? C Well, I was an accounting major, but I ended up getting an apprenticeship working in orthotics. Prosthetics. So I worked as an orthotics prosthetic technician for 16 years. I enjoyed that. B What do you do now? C Now I get a veteran's pension. Kind of retired because I got PTSD and depression, and I just. They told me I'm 90% disabled. I really. You know, it's kind of. I don't know. B What's your dream job? C Well, I'd like to be crime scene investigator. That would be it if I had to choose you? Yeah. I'm somewhat shy. Per. Intimate enough. I'm working or something. I'm not because I know what I got to do and I know how to communicate, but just on a personal level with people. I am. Fear of. Fear of intimacy, I guess. The PTSD and mastectomies. B What about your relationship with your family? C It's strange. My dad's in there. B Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? C I play video games. I get on the computer and play some games, and it. I get focused on that, and it's relaxing for me, and it takes my mind off stuff. B How are you at controlling your temper? C I try not to. Well, I saw a therapist for six years dealing with anger issues after. I'm a Vietnam veteran. I'm on psych meds, so I guess that controls it. B When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? C Oh, a friend of mine wants to come over, and she's scheduled to come over Wednesday, tomorrow. And somebody else came up with something they wanted her to do, and she just felt like she could call me and cancel with me and go out with a friend, and I. I told her, say it's not going to work. You're gonna. You have to stick with you. You made it. You made a. You made a appointment with me first, so you're gonna have to deal with that. I got kind of frustrated because I. She just felt like she could, you know, call and make it, make plans and cancel anytime, and I don't like it. B Tell Me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. C Probably the way I handled the breast. When I found out I had breast cancer, stage three, I would have got a support group right away, which I. I didn't see a social worker right away. I was in. Didn't. I was running a prosthetic lab and I was more worried about that than my breast cancer. I think I would have done that different. B What's something you feel guilty about? C Well then I did try to be more involved with my sister's lives and stay closer to home. Up to Pacific Northwest. B Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. C All the years of drinking alcoholic for a long time. But I was self medicating, so I wish I could not have done that. B Have you ever served in the military? C Yes. U.S. army, Vietnam veteran. B How old were you when you joined the military? C 23. B Why did you decide to enlist in the military? C Well, my mother thought it would be a good. I was more of a hippie and she thought if I got in the military it would, it would be. It would help straighten me out, which it helps somewhat. I did change after that, but I had some problems after I left too. B Are you happy you did that? C Well now, yeah, now I am because it's. I guess I should have stayed in longer. Did 20 years and retired. B Did you ever see combat? C No. During the Vietnam era, women weren't allowed to go to combat. Learning to fire. The M16 was optional. So I never. I was in communications which was. I cried or top security. Clear clearance. B I'm sorry. C Yeah. B How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? C Well, I look back now, I can see where some of the started drinking and I was acting goofy and I can see back. It was the PTSD and the trauma and stuff. I never saw it that way then, but I can look back now and see why some things happened. B What did you do after the military? C Well, the first thing I did was get a job as a bartender mixed with people. Then I went to work for an insurance company for about four years. I took some college business, college classes. I worked with outside Chicago for a long time and then I ended up working 16 years in prosthetics and orthotics. And I didn't drink for 15 years. I didn't smoke cigarettes for 10 years. And then so I found out I had breast cancer, stage three. So it kind of changed my plans. B How did serving in a building. C I get panic attacks and it's like I get startled easily. Like one time I was on a bus and I fell asleep and something startled me. And the bus driver knew right away. He said, you're a veteran, aren't you? I mean, just the way I was acting. He knew. So it changed me and I started numbing a little depressed. A little depressed. I don't know. High. Holidays are coming up. This is a month of aloo. It's starting tonight. And it's time for introspection. So I look at the past year, what I've done, and I just. I don't think I've done that much, you know. B Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? C I'm a little more depressed. I'm taking medications for it, but I guess I just gotta wait it out and. I don't know. B Tell me about that. C Well, a couple people I know died and friend of mine moved out and it's been depressing to see that happen. Three people I know died in the last three or four months, you know, so it's been a little depressing there. But I don't know. B How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? C It's not too easy. B What are you like when you don't sleep well? C Well, probably irritable and have hard. I don't really want to be around people. I get restless times. I can be tired and can't sleep. So I try. I'll play a computer game. It's my only answer to getting my mind off stuff. B Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? C Yes, I got it. Being startled easily. B Are they triggered by something. C I like? I don't like people standing too close to me and I get tired. I have social anxiety now. I don't like to be around a lot of people, like going to the. Like if they had a jazz festival or something, I wouldn't want to be there because of all those people, I'm isolated more. B How do you cope with them? C I don't know. I just try to play computer games. I sleep. It's hard for me to focus. B Can you tell me about that? C Not really. I can't explain it myself. B What got you to seek help? C Well, I'm a veteran in substance abuse treatment center at the va. Veterans rep caught me and told me about the va and so I went up there and I felt it was my last resort really, because I was lost for what to do. Finally reached that point. So, yeah. Yes. I go to group therapy once a week. I have a psychiatrist. I see. B Do you feel therapy is useful? C Yes. Yes. Tell me more about that. Well, it helps you. Not a scattered brain. B When was the last time you felt really happy? C I don't know. B Can you tell me about that? C I just don't know. I can't remember. B Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? C I don't know of anyone. B Tell me more about that. C I just can't think of anyone right now. B How would your best friend describe you? C Loner. B Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. C I played dominoes with people. B Nice. C Pretty good at dominoes. But I kind of enjoyed today something interesting. B What are you most proud of in your life? C That I. That I worked in a field. I fabricated a lot of artificial limbs and braces. It was something people could use and I'm really skilled in that area. And that was quite an accomplishment for me. B Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. C Well, thank you for being here. A Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and stop the recording. You can take that number off of your shirt and I'll throw it away for you. I'm just going to stop all these things and then I will pay you and then walk you back over. B So just give me one second.

"A wow. B Yeah, it's a lot of different things. So I'm going to talk about the virtual demon right now, then I'm going to reduce it again. A good. I broke it. C why does it happen? He. B Lots of waiting. Sorry for that. A step so good. All right. B Very good. She will ask you a series of questions, then when she has finished, she should say goodbye. And you can press this button and. I will come back and I install you. B and if for any reason, she stops speaking for 10 to 15, 15 seconds, something could have bad. And you can press this button. A good. C questions? A no should be good. C hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will answer the questions, I make us start and do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? A yes. C agree. So how are you today? A I am fine. It's great. Where do you come from? Run originally, I was born in Denver, Colorado. What are the things you really like in O? A like the beach, the sun, the pretty girls, the ocean. Lots of things. What are the things you don't really like at it? An SMOG, an excess number of people in traffic that can be treated. I would like to travel more. What do you like now? A trip, see new things and maybe learn a new culture or something. Oh okay. I. When I was younger, I went to Europe and I just did the hiking thing. Going back to Europe for a little while and it was really fun. What is one of your most memorable experiences? Probably just in the army with friends and things like that. C What do you study at school? A well, I have a cinema diploma and I also finish a diploma in or for business. C what are you doing now? R Now I'm looking for work. I try to make a kind of entrepreneurial effort now because I finish my diploma in trade. What is your dream work? It would probably be to own my own business. It is in a way why I want a kind of entrepreneurial effort to advance with a kind of interesting product or service on which I work. Are you considering more shy or outgoing? R I would say in the middle of the road, a little shy and can sometimes be a wild warm -up. C why? R I'm just prudent to meet someone new, then to see where to go from there, I suppose. C Tell me about your relationship with your family? To my family, they always live in Colorado. They are interesting and good people too. I probably speak to them a few times a week. They are good people. I have a brother and he has a few children and he is also married. C sometimes, when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? A This is a good question. Lately, I tried to get a daily exercise, such as jogging or cycling. I recently had a bike, something like that. On a daily effort, for the most part, good enough. I try. If I have an explosion or if I am irritable, I try to stay away from people because I don't like to go on people, they have done nothing wrong or do not change the subject in my mind. I guess what causes me to trouble would be more I avoid things and that it accumulates and worsen and this kind of difficulty. Yeah. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? Basically in a relationship, arguing with a girlfriend. To be honest with you, I don't remember exactly what it was. It is probably that one of us is irritable and me and from there, or it is probably a lot to do with money too. I do not have the best financial security at this stage. C you want to manage differently. A This is a good question. I suppose that I feed a little guilt of the military as regards the departure and that people are always in it, I suppose. But no, it's. It's no longer for me. C tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. Okay, tell me about an event or if something you want to be able to erase from your memory. Let me think. Well, I worked for a friend and I invested in his business and the economy dropped. It was a construction accessories company, and the economy dropped and we lost most of our money like most people in America. And it's about a good and a bad thing. I guess you have to look at him good, good point of view. But that definitely put me in a financially tailspin and could really do nothing about it. Almost sheltered for a little while. But I want I would not have invested in the business and that I will go ahead and maybe go to school as if I go anyway. Anyway. C have you already served in the army? A I have. What age were you? R I was 21 years old. I wanted a life change. I wanted more real experiences, served my country and the additional advantages of going to school were nice. I did not have much financial capacity at that time and I wanted to change to get out of my current situation. And it was the best way out, I thought. Are you happy that you did that? A yeah, yeah, I am very happy to have joined the army. I now appreciate more than I have come out and that I understand what I guess that war was talking about is definitely people and me too. C Have you ever seen the fight? A yeah, I also tour in Iraq and Afghanistan. How was it easy for me to go back to civilian life? We see, I thought at the beginning that it was very easy, then I came to understand that it was very difficult just because I adapted myself from military life instead of having it in my head and not so far. I realized that a few months ago, you know, I reintegrate a little better in civilian life, which is. It's actually. It is actually quite difficult. No problem. Let me think. I. When I left the army first is me. I invested, as I said, in my friend's business and we launched this small business. We were going well for a while, working and then lost all our money. And then I traveled for a while, which, I understand now, is obviously a few other problems, but I have traveled everywhere in America by working and I went to school in New York for a little while, I lived in a few different states and I returned to Canada, in California, where I finish school, I finally live the dream. C How has the army service changed you? A This is a good question. I would say. Well, that instills you with a very good, I think, a meaning. Feeling of character and strength and, you know, I think there are a lot of good qualities that the military, our soldiers, put in people, but at the same time, it also puts a lot of poor qualities, because you need a kind of advantage or something you need on the most daily. And if you don't understand that, then you know, a lot of guys, you know, turn to drinking or drugs just because you can't get this same edge and that really. It can really hurt you or have you beneficial. C How do you receive yourself recently? R I feel good. I have had a little sinus problem lately, but I feel good. C have you noticed these changes in your behavior or your thoughts lately? In fact, my thoughts. I really had dispersed thoughts and I would say that I start to get a little B It is better clarity, which is good. I took a lot of therapy and stuff like that, and it actually helped. C agree. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? To it varies. I can't really. The difficult part for me is the calendar because it is. If I'm not tired, you don't sleep. Sleep. You just stayed there. It's really struck or missed, really. Some nights, I can sleep well. Some nights, I have to wait for me to be exhausted. And I don't like to make pills. The pills are bad. I understand that. But it is fundamentally cannot sleep because either you. My mind always thinks of something or something I think I have to do, but yet I do nothing. This is not true. I try to always do something or. Yeah, I mean, I sometimes have disturbing dreams, but it doesn't really deny that I sleep. Sleep. It wakes me up, that's what it does, because it can be the dream you remember in relation to the one you don't have. C sleep well. R When I don't sleep well, maybe irritability and anxiety increase definitively. I really get. I tend to get a lot of headache, and not sleep very well certainly puts that in the mixture. C Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? A I have. C agree. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? I don't know. No. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? A hmm. I don't know. Try to feel happiness daily, I guess it would be a good answer, but I'm not sure. It's good. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? To I would say that my father was a very positive influence. C How would your best friend describe you? A This is a good question. Charismatic, funny guy, quite hard, probably a good worker, I would say. I really liked to jog the other day on the beach. What are you the most proud in your life? A hmm. Something I am most proud of, I would say. I am also an online minister. And I married my brother and his wife, and it was a fairly proud experience. C agree. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. To her said goodbye. It's good. It is very understandable. B Close everything. You can move there. C agree.

Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B Play on the computer. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Not very good. A When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? B Probably a week ago. And it was just an issue over a coffee pot. A Mm. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Um, over at a friend's house, I really wanted to leave. I felt it was rude to leave so early, so I stuck it out for six hours, and I just was probably the worst guest so that I would change. A What's something you feel guilty about? B Something I shouldn't feel guilty about, I'm sure. A Mm. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B The hardest decision, I think, was going in for treatment for ptsd. A All right. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Oh, a Couple of things, but I think my childhood sexual abuse, I'd erase that. A Have you ever served in the military? B Yes. A How old were you when you joined the military? B 17. A Why did you decide to enlist in the military? B Basically it was an escape method. A Are you happy you did that? B Yes. A Did you ever see combat? B Yes. A All right. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? B It wasn't easy at all. Especially during that time. A Okay. What did you do after the military? B I went to school and started working. A All right. How did serving in the military change you? B I think it helped me to become more mature, more sure of myself. A All right. How have you been feeling lately? B Depressed mostly. Due to ptsd? Not really. This has been going on for quite some time now. A Alright. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Not very. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B I'm even more irritable. I have even more of a flash temper. It makes depression worse, anxiety worse. A All right. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Yes. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B The formal diagnosis was probably about four years ago. A What were your symptoms? B Depression, anxiety, flashbacks, body memories. Nightmares? A Are they triggered by something. B The dreams are not, the nightmares are not. Generally only touch triggers. Me. As far as from other people. A How do you cope with them? B Somewhat with medication. A Can you tell me about that? B Well, I take a boatload of medications now. Treatment for ptsd? It's also for depression, anxiety and sleep. A What got you to seek help? B Because I knew I was going to kill myself if I didn't. A Do you still go to therapy now? B Yes. A Do you feel therapy is useful? B I'm not sure yet. A All right. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? B None yet. A When was the last time you felt really happy? B I don't remember a time. A Can you tell me about that? B No. There was no. I would have never classified myself as happy at any time in my life. A Who's someone that's been a positive advantage influence in your life? B No one. A Can you tell me about that?

"A All right, looks good. I'm going to put it right here, so when she's done, she'll let you know and then you can let me know. B Okay, thanks. Thanks. A Go ahead and move this cord behind you just so it doesn't get in your way. Hi. B Hello. A Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask if you have questions and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Okay, not too bad. A That's good. Where are you from? B Originally I'm from Chicago, south side. A When did you move to LA? B Back in 1978, when I was 18. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B Lately, not much. Maybe once every two or three years. A How does it compare to la? B It's totally different, you know, horrible weather and. Yeah, it's just a whole different atmosphere. A Why'd you move to la? B Let's see, my mother had moved to Africa. I graduated from high school and I had a friend out here, so I just thought, well, let me try la. A Okay. How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B Very easy, actually. Yeah, I loved it from the moment I got off the airplane. Yeah. A What are some things you really like about la? B Number one, the weather. Sun is very important to me, so I love the weather. I don't know, just kind of a more laid back atmosphere, variety of people. And now it's my. My home base, you know, my friends that are family. So it's kind of like my family is here now. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B Huh? I guess the smog, earthquakes, traffic, just basic things like that. Really? A Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B I don't currently, but I did throughout my life. I traveled quite a lot. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Just seeing. Seeing other cultures and seeing more history and meeting people and just fun. The fun of it as well. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B See, well, one trip I went to England, Ireland and Scotland and France, all in, you know, one trip. So that was a nice variety. A Nice. What's one of your most memorable experiences? B I guess you could say probably skiing in Val d'serre, France. That was fun. I'm glad I got to do that. A That's great. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I'm kind of shy by nature. I've tried to grow out of being shy, so I'm not fully shy, but I was always an extremely shy child. But now here in Culver City, this is my environment, and I. I guess you could say I'm not really shy. In. In my hometown of Culver City. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B To relax. I like to just curl up in my bed and read my book, take a nap, watch TV sometimes on the couch in the living room. Just, you know, stay at home and kind of vegetate. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Pretty good. Yeah, My temper is pretty level. A When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? B H. Probably with my husband, and I can't remember at the moment what it was about. A Okay, tell me about your relationship with your family. B Well, when you say my family, do you mean my family from childhood or my current family? Okay, well, I guess my current family comes to mind. I. I have two daughters, and my relationship's pretty good. It's okay with them, but they're teenagers, which, you know, going. They're going through a lot of hormones, and they can be kind of bitchy and. And. But I have hope that, you know, they'll grow out of that. And so soon, someday we'll have a really good relationship. And then there's the husband, which I. I guess I could say soon to be ex husband. Hopefully soon. We need to get a divorce, but we're still together due to financial reasons and. Yeah, yeah, so that. That's not good, the. The relationship with the husband. But. But since we have determined that we need to divorce our. We don't expect anything out of each other, so we don't argue as much. So that's good. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle different. B Hmm. Wow. I guess our marriage. I wish I'd noticed early on that, you know, it was, like, way off from what I thought it was. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B See? Oh, my God. Hardest decision. I guess leaving my first husband, that was pretty hard. A Can you tell me about that? B Well, you know, we were married, and I wasn't content, I guess you could say. And I kind of just gave up on our relationship. Now that I look back, I think it's Because I wanted children, and he would have been happy to never have any. And so since I didn't have a father, it was very important that I create children with someone who really wanted to be a father. And so I was kind of at an age where I needed to start thinking about having children, yet I was with someone who really was not into it. So that I think that's one maybe the core reason why I was not content. And I just felt like this marriage isn't going to work. And so, you know, we went to therapy and everything, and he did not want to break up, and. And I had to leave him because I just wasn't happy. And that. That was very hard because, you know, I felt like I was hurting him, which. Which I was, you know, and he survived. He got over it. Now he's married with two kids, but it was hard to leave him. A Yeah. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Hmm. Something I wish I could erase from my memory. I have to think about that. I'm sure there's something. Ah, well, yeah, there's. I guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory a recent. I'm not recent, but an event in my recent adulthood here in Culver City, where one of my best friends I've betrayed me by. Back years ago, when my husband first got into real estate, she and her family were growing, and they really needed a larger home. And we just assumed, you know, that they would use my husband as their agent, both to sell their current home. Current at the time, and to purchase a new home. And as it turned out, they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent. And, yeah, that was devastating. I don't think I had ever been betrayed like that. So I wish I could erase that now because now, you know, this was back when the kids were really young. And my daughter at the time, my youngest daughter was, let's say six, maybe. Maybe five. Anyway, her and my best friend's daughter are the same age. They were born within days of each other. We were pregnant together, and they were really tight, those two little girls. And they ended up not going to the same elementary school, so they didn't get to hang out during those years. But every time we'd run into them in the neighborhood or they'd run into each other at a summer camp or something, they were just so connected. They were just, you know, like two peas in a pod, even though their. Their moms weren't talking to each other anymore. So now they're 13 and 14, and they're in middle school together, and they're still very connected. In fact, she. She, for the first time, spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl. And it's just a little awkward, you know, because now these girls are becoming really good friends, better friends. And yet I still have this vivid, bad memory of what her. Her mom did to. To me. That was about, what, 10, about eight years ago. Anyway, I tried it. I tried to ignore it and put it out of my head, which I've been able to in recent years, but obviously it still comes up. Anyway, that. That was. That. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Not that easy. I do sometimes get a decent night's sleep, but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep. And most of the time I wake up and can't get back to sleep. Or I finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up. You know, that difficult thing. Well, the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom. And then, you know, it's not always that easy to get back to sleep. And then I wake up again to go to the bathroom. So I guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep. Having a hard time there? I don't know. I think there's just too much on my mind, running through my mind in the day, and I feel like I haven't accomplished enough during the day. So it's hard for me to just go to sleep when I'm supposed to, I guess. A What are you like when you sleep? Well. B I'm kind of used to it now. I just go on through the day probably looking. Looking tired. And I'm kind of used to feeling tired. I just do what I need to do. And sometimes if I'm able to, if I'm at home and don't have huge commitments. Yeah, I might just, like I said earlier, just take a nap or something, read my book, watch tv, whatever. Lately, how have I been feeling? Kind of down on myself, down on life. A Can you tell me about that? B Well, I have this pending need for separation slash divorce. I worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls. Now they're teenagers, you know, on the verge of adulthood. And so I worry that, you know, I did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance and their early childhood, and now it's too late. Like, I missed out on a lot of things and, yeah, I need a job. I'M unemployed. I don't know what I want to do with my life. I know I want to do something. I. I just wish, you know, I never did finish college, unfortunately, because I was traveling and stuff. So I regret that extremely. And I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself because I need to divorce and move on with my life. So now I forget what the original question was, but that's the state. Part of the state of my life. A Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yes. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B Well, the first time or recently? The first time, I guess, was, you know, when I was in my early 20s. I was just a little upset about. Coincidentally, that was another breakup I had to make. Back then, I was in my early 20s, and I needed to break up with my boyfriend. But again, it was very upsetting because I. You know, it was hard because he didn't want to break up, and I felt like I was hurting him. And I didn't understand this feeling. I was really upset, and I didn't. That was my first time having depression, so I didn't really recognize it as depression, but I went. Somehow I had the knowledge or the. I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist. I remember I paid for her by the hour, and she prescribed Xanax to just help relax me. And so I guess that helped me get through that. And then I've had depression throughout the years. Just, you know, little bits here and there for various reasons. Such as? I guess it's usually a relationship, you know. Yeah. So the most recent time I was diagnosed and put on meds, that was probably about two years ago. A Do you still go to therapy now? B No. A Why did you stop? B Money. I don't have insurance, otherwise. Yeah, I'd be happy to go to therapy. Anything that might help. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Ooh, boy. Last time I felt really happy. I don't know. I guess maybe when my children were born. That's, I guess, happy. I don't know. I just, you know, I always wanted children, so it was nice to have them. That's. I don't know. That's all I can remember of that. I guess I don't remember the good times too well. I remember the bad times. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Hmm. Something I did that I really enjoyed? Well, let's see. Friday night, I went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends, and we created vision Boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house. That was. That was fun. Yeah, we get to stay in college, get my degree, get therapy, try to become happy. Yeah. Try to figure out things earlier in life, like, yeah, stay in college. And mainly, I think the main, you know, what it all boils down to. No matter what you're depressed about, it seems like as the saying goes and the songs go, you know, it's all about money. The world revolves around money and having none. That in itself is very depressing. So besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life, having no money is, you know, it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it. So with that in mind, I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to get a job and stick with it. Don't quit to go traveling. You know, just stick with the job, stick with a company, build up your seniority, keep your benefits, and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of field. Yeah, that would have been my biggest piece of advice to myself. A Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? B Not much, I guess, just my daughters. You know, they're beautiful daughters, and I'm proud and glad that I was able to have children. Some people aren't even able to do that, you know, and they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it. So that's the one thing. I mean, I wanted five children and I always wanted a boy, which I never had. But I guess that's the biggest thing I can think of to be proud of is having my two daughters. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm a very loyal friend and person. That's why when that friend betrayed me, it was so devastating. Yeah, very loyal, very happy. What was I going to say? I was going to say, happy. Go lucky. I don't know where that came from. Very. I meant to say friendly and caring and. Yeah, I care about people and I'm interested in people and I care about animals as well, actually. That's another thing I'm proud of. Proud of being a vegetarian. Yeah. So my daughters and being vegetarian, and I'm a vegetarian because I really care about feelings of other beings, not only humans, but animals, too. And, you know, I don't think that animals should be tortured and live a torturous life just so we can eat them. So what was the question? Do you remember the question? A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. B Okay. A Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B You're welcome. Bye. I did need the tissue one time, so that's good.

"A good, perfect. B seems that we are good to leave. C so I will evoke our virtual hero. To you will see his kind flying here. C I think it's really an incredible invention. B I know, isn't it. A they continue to become more incredible. B I feel like. A ok, so she's there. C no, she looks like a comic book character. Yeah, she looks like one of them, as if you play the Sims or something like that. R I know what you mean. Very well, so I'm going to go ahead and start it. C very good. R Again, when she says goodbye, go for it and press this button. I will come back for you. All right. Hey, I'm here. B I'm Ellie. C thank you for coming today. B I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. He. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started and do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? C yes. B ok. C I am. B How are you today? It's a little nervous, you know, not knowing what to expect, but I'm fine. What do you want? North West Pacific, Washington State? B The things you really like at La. C Weteo, the variety of things you can do and the variety of people and Hollywood, cinema stars and things that are there. It is very liberal, really, compared to many places. B What are the things you don't really like at it? C traffic becomes larger and this evening will be very impersonal. And, you know, when you meet people, you know, it takes a while to teach them to trust them. I have a lot of players in Los Angeles. B do you travel a lot? It was the habit. No more. B What do you have to travel? Well, when I traveled, I was. It was just to go elsewhere and be with a certain group of people to do workshops and stuff. But now I don't like. I would not want to fly anymore because of all the restrictions and problems they have had since 9 11. B I would like to hear from one of your trips. That's good, I gave myself up for. Well, I used to fly a lot in the San Francisco region and I was with a group of people who recovered. We have done rituals and workshops and I spent a little time doing a lot of workshops. We were outside, so I love him a little. We would have a week of campsite and have small workshops and get to know people from different parts of the country. Find out what's going on. B What is one of your most memorable experiences? C find out that I had breast cancer, stadium three. It was really this one ? I did 11 surgeries. Types of tumors. The breast cancers returned, but I had tumors. I suffered 11 surgeries because of the tumors. Tumors on my ovary, tumor on my kidney. I even had one. Something on my thyroid, they had to remove. So it was an experience. B it's great. What have you studied at school? That's good, I was a major in accounting, but I ended up operating an learning in orthotics. Prostheses. So I worked as an orthical prosthetic technician for 16 years. I enjoyed it. B What are you doing now? C now, I receive a pension from a veteran. A little retired because I got the SSPT and depression, and I'm just. They told me that I am 90%handicapped. I'm really. You know, it's a bit. I don't know. B What is your dream work? Well, I would like to be an investigator on the scene of the crime. It would be all if I had to choose you? Yeah. I'm a bit shy. By. Quite intimate. I work or something like that. I am not because I know what I have to do and I know how to communicate, but just at a personal level with people. I am. Fear of. Fear of intimacy, I suppose. The SSPT and the Mastectomies. B What about your relationship with your family? C it's strange. My father is in there. B Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? C I play video games. I get on the computer and play games, and that. I focus on this, and it's relaxing for me, and it makes me hear things. B How are you going to control your temperament? C I try not to do it. Well, I saw a therapist for six years dealing with anger problems afterwards. I am a veteran of Vietnam. I'm on Psych Medds, so I guess it controls it. B when when you go back the last time you argued with someone, what was it? C Oh, one of my friends wants to come, and she has to come on Wednesday tomorrow. And someone else found something he wanted her to do, and she just felt like she could call me and cancel with me and go out with a friend, and me. I said to him, say it won't work. You go. You have to stay with you. You did it. You made one. You first made an appointment with me, so you will have to face it. I became a little frustrated because I. B tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. It probably the way I managed the breast. When I discovered that I had breast cancer, the third step, I would have immediately had a support group, which I did not see any social worker rig HT Away. I was in it. I didn't do it. I directed a prosthetic laboratory and I was more worried about this than my breast cancer. I think I would have done that different. B What do you feel guilty? Well, I tried to be more involved in my sister's life and stay closer to my home. Until Pacific Northwest. B tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. Tell me about an event or something you want you to erase from your memory. C all years of drinking alcoholic for a long time. But I made myself, so I would have liked not being able to do this. B Have you ever served in the army? C yes. American army, veteran of Vietnam. B How old was you when you joined the army? C 23. B Why did you decided to enlist you in the army? Well, my mother thought it would be a good. I was no longer a hippie and she thought that if I was going to the army, it would be the case. It would help straighten me, which helps a little. I changed after that, but I had some problems after my departure too. B are you happy that you did that? Well now, yes, now I am because it is. I guess I should have stayed longer. Was 20 years old and retired. B Have you ever seen fights? C no. During the era of Vietnam, women were not allowed to go to battle. Learn to shoot. The M16 was optional. So I never have. I was in communication that was. I cried or superior security. Clear Clarance. B I'm sorry. C yeah. B How easy for you to go back to civilian life? Well, I look back now, I can see where part of the alcohol consumption has started and I was awkward and I can see again. It was the SSPT and the trauma and all that. I have never seen it this way then, but I can look back and see why some things happened. B What did you do after the army? Well, the first thing I did was find a job as a bartender mixed with people. Then I went to work for an insurance company for about four years. I took academic affairs, college lessons. I worked with the outside of Chicago for a long time, then I ended up working 16 years in prostheses and orthotics. And I haven't been drinking for 15 years. I have not smoked cigarettes for 10 years. And then I discovered that I had breast cancer, stage three. So it changed my plans. B How to serve in a building. C I get panic attacks and it's as if I was easily surprised. Like once, I was on a bus and I fell asleep and something surprised me. And the bus driver knew right away. He said, you're a veteran, right? I mean, just the way I act. He knew. So it changes D Me and I started to numb a little depressed. A little depressed. I don't know. High. The holidays are coming. It's a month of aloo. It starts tonight. And it's time for introspection. So I look at last year, which I did, and I'm just. I don't think I have done a lot, you know. B Have you noticed these changes in your behavior or your thoughts lately? C I am a little more depressed. I take medication for that, but I guess I just have to wait and. I don't know. B tell me about that. Well, a few people I know are dead and my friend has moved and it was depressing to see that it happens. Three people I know have died in the last three or four months, you know, so it has been a little depressing there. But I don't know. B How easy for you to have a good night's sleep? It is not too easy. B How are you when you don't sleep well? That is good, probably irritable and has trouble. I don't really want to be with people. I receive agitated times. I can be tired and I can't sleep. So I try. I will play a computer game. This is my only answer to get rid of things. B Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? C yes, I got it. Be easily surprised. B are they triggered by something. C I like? I don't like people to stand too close to me and I am tired. I have social anxiety now. I don't like being with many people, like going to. As if they had a jazz festival or something like that, I would not want to be there because of all these people, I am more isolated. B How do you face it? C I don't know. I'm just trying to play computer games. I sleep. It's hard for me to concentrate. B Can you tell me? It's not really. I can't explain it myself. B What made you ask for help? Well, I am a veteran of the drug addiction treatment center. The representative of the veterans caught me and told me about the way and I therefore went up there and I felt that it was really my last resort, because I was lost for what to do. Finally reached this point. So, yes. Yes. I go to group therapy once a week. I have a psychiatrist. I see. B Do you think therapy is useful? C yes. Yes. Tell me more about it. Well, that helps you. Not a dispersed brain. B when will you go back the last time you felt really happy? C I don't know. B Can you tell me? C I don't know. I don't remember. B Who is someone who has had a positive influence in your life? C I don't know anyone. B tell me more about it. C I can't think of anyone for the moment. B How would your best friend describe you? C loner. B tell me about som You recently made you really enjoyed it. C I played dominoes with people. B well. C fairly good in dominoes. But I somehow appreciated something interesting today. B What are you the most proud in your life? C that me. That I worked in an area. I made a lot of artificial members and suspenders. It was something that people could use and I am really qualified in this area. And it was a whole accomplishment for me. B ok. I think I asked for everything I need.

B Yes, I work in the music industry. A Awesome. How did you decide to do that? B It was a passion of mine and I got into school and went with it. A How hard is that? B How hard is what? A What's your dream job? B I don't really have a dream job. I don't know if that exists, actually. It's probably changing all the time. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Depends on the situation. Sometimes I'm shy and sometimes I'm outgoing. A I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B Well, I can't see your shoes, but I like to travel, yes. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Meeting new people, seeing new things, exploring the landscape. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B I went to Alaska on a fishing trip. A Nice. What's one of your most memorable experiences. B On that trip? Catching an octopus. A Can you tell me about that? B I was deep sea fishing and for halibut. And rather than catching a halibut, I lured in a octopus. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. B I play golf, I swim, I read. A How are you at controlling your temper? B I'm pretty calm. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Probably a couple days ago, but it was. And it was about a musical project I was involved in. A How did you feel in that moment? B I felt heated. A Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? B I'm not quite sure. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently? B I'm not quite sure. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B I'd have to think about that for a while. A Whatever comes to your mind. B I'm not really sure. A Okay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B I had a bad performance one time and I wish people who I knew didn't see it. A Why? B Because we weren't well rehearsed and I was embarrassed afterwards. A I see what you mean. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B I have a brother and parents who are divorced. A How close are you to your family? B I'm pretty close. I see them regularly, talk openly about most subjects. A That's great. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B My brother. A Tell me more about that. B What do you want to know? A Whatever comes to your mind. B About my brother. I'm not really sure. A Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Most of the time it's pretty easy. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B I drink more coffee to compensate. A How have you been feeling lately? B Fine. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B No. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B What does PTSD stand for? A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No, I haven't. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B I'm happy all the time. A How would your best friend describe you? B Ambitious. A go getter. Feisty. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B I'm not quite sure. A Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. B I can't recall right now. A Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B I went to a concert, saw live music, drank good beer. A Nice. B Yeah. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm a good listener, I'm passionate, and I'm alert. A Okay. Is there anything you regret. B Ever? In regards to what? No, I don't. I don't. I normally don't regret things because there's too much else to live for to think about the past. Do you? Okay. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B What was that question? A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B To read more and watch TV, watch the computer screen less. Because that makes you have attention deficit disorder and you focus less on things that are in front of you in real life. I know. I exercise. I sleep in late. I go golfing from time to time. I go to concerts, I go to bars, hang out with friends at the beach. It depends. A What are you most proud of in your life? B What am I most proud of? I'm healthy and I understand the world around me and I'm passionate about things that I'm doing. And I have goals that I've set that I'm working towards. Yeah. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B What was your name? A I'm Ellie. B That's right. Goodbye.

"A It. Okay, so once again, when she says goodbye, press this button. B Okay. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get it started, and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing pretty good. A Where are you from originally? B I was born and raised right here in Los Angeles. A Really? What are some things you really like about la? B The weather would be number one. I also like the diverse cultures. I like the fact that there's a lot of different things here you can do, and there's a lot of opportunity here, not just for myself, but for my kids. And I think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career, go to school, learn about different people. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B The traffic, the cost of living. Sometimes I think it's too big. And I think the transportation system, as far as the bus and trains is long overdue. They need to revamp it or, you know, add more buses and things like that. Just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation. A I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B I travel when I can, a little bit here and there. I have not been overseas yet, which is a goal of mine within the next couple. Couple of years. So I've just traveled domestically. I try to take at least one trip a year somewhere. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B I just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places. Going particularly somewhere I've never been and learning about that place, you know, like. So if I'm going to dc, I really look forward to it because it's a historic city, you know, things like that. My most recent trip would have been D.C. last year. I went to go visit a friend, and I stayed about, I think, three to four days, and I got to see the Capitol. He showed me around, showed me all the, you know, historic landmarks and sites, the White House, the Capitol building. I got to see a lot of other different government buildings, and it was. It was a good experience. The irony was I had to fly on 9 11, and so that had me a little uneasy. But once I was in the plane, up in the air, I was okay. And it was all good. And once I was back home, I was like, yes, but I missed the trip and I look forward to going back. A Nice. What's my. B Attending my friend's wedding. She had a destination wedding in Hawaii, actually Maui. That was actually two, three, three years ago. Three years ago in August. And I've been trying to get back ever since and I want to take my kids and I just love it there and I actually kind of look forward to, to moving there one day. A Tell me about your kids. B I have three sons, 13 year old, twins, boys. And my youngest is also a boy, he's 8. They all have birthdays in June. The twins are June 9th and my baby is June 4th. And so they're just a few days apart, but five years apart technically. And they're just super, super typical boys, active all over the place, hormones, puberty. So it's actually an interesting time because you know, the two older boys are going through puberty, their teenage years. My youngest still trying to figure some things out for himself, you know, doing that transition stage of 8 to 9 years old. So he'll be 9 in June and then my oldest would be 14, so. So it's a challenging time for me as well. Just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent every day and seeing how just with love and nurturing and the right and you know, well, I can't say proper development but just with, you know, love and nurturing. How a baby grows into a toddler, into, you know, a young boy to a teenager and then into a young man. And so that experience alone has been rewarding. Just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages and seeing how they have developed and you know, seeing some of the things that they're going through now that so reminiscent of my teenage years. And it's just, it's very rewarding and actually I look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and off in college because I really love children and giving back. A That's so good to hear. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? B There's probably a couple of things, but I would just say for me being a single parent is the financial. Well, I would say that along with some of the emotional, with them having to bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child, child rearing, you know, the, just the everyday things of what you have to deal with. Sometimes when you're just tired, you don't want to be bothered or you're trying to do things for yourself. You have to be reminded that, okay, I gotta cook or I have to go pick my son up or I have to take him to baseball practice. This one wants to go over here, this one is acting moody and, you know, just those, those types of challenges as well as the financial and, you know, making sure, you know, you're able to put food on the table, you're paying your rent, and, you know, you're keeping up with the day to day. And that's. Those two are probably the hardest things for me to deal with. Well, I just take it day by day. I just put one foot in front of the other. And I'm extremely spiritual, so I just rely on God and pray a lot, meditate if I see I need a little help, if, you know, I'm not above asking for help. So sometimes if I have to reach out to people or see what other resources are out there to, to help me, you know, try to do that. And so for me right now, my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better economic situation so I can continue to provide for them comfortably. A What did you study at school? B I studied communications, actually. I was a journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology. And now I'm studying business. I just thought that, you know, there would be more opportunities for me with business as far as jobs. And then I, you know, have a desire to go to graduate school. So I just figured in the long run it was a better. It would put me in a better position, give me more opportunities with the communications. It's a little limited. And especially as you get older, the fields of TV reporting and things like that are kind of become, you know, harder to obtain. So I just thought I would go into something more realistic and, you know, but I like both fields. I really do. I like communicating, writing, reading, talking, as you can tell, and so we'll see. A What's your dream job? B A couple, probably, but I would say ultimately would be traveling, like working as, like a travel writer, going to different destinations, trying different foods out, writing about different people, cultures, learning and living, you know, about those different people and cultures, living amongst the, you know, the, the people there and being interactive with the children and stuff like that. So I kind of hope to be able to do that one day. But yes, it would be something along those lines. And then the fallback would be a counselor, social worker, something in that area. If I could encompass all three, hopefully I can. I would like to do that. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B That's actually a hard question, probably because I initially grew up very shy. And I'm not so much shy as I am reserved now, but not conservative, but just reserved. And, you know, when I go somewhere, I'm checking everything, everybody else out. And then once I become comfortable or acclimate to a situation, then I'm like, okay, you know, I warm up to the. To the situation or the people. But I'm also friendly. I can be very friendly and outgoing. I like to talk. You know, I seem like a chatterbox, but I'm not really. So usually if I'm in a big space with a whole lot of people, I don't like to be the center of attention. I can attach myself to one or two people and, you know, become friendly with them. But I. Overall, I am an open, friendly person. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but. B It'S the best I've got. A What do you do to relax? B For me, it's. It could be something as simple as just unplugging everything, all electronics, and just sitting for a few moments, meditating, praying, or reading a good spiritual scripture, if I'm able to. I like to go for a good massage, maybe get a facial, you know, things that will. I kind of like the physical part. Part of it. I like massages, things that really release tension, and if not, then just, like I said, just sitting at home reading and praying or. I like the beach. I love the beach. So sometimes I drive and go sit by the beach. I also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself or get them mani pedi or maybe go window shopping, you know, things like that. A Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? B Pretty good. Sometimes I'm just like. I don't really have so much an issue with the temper as I am. I just. I'm more impatient, unfortunately, a lot of times with people and, you know, situations. So I just can become really irritated or irritable, quite agitated. Especially if it's that time of the month for me, I just lose patience. Outside of that, I'm actually pretty good. I try to be very, you know, conscious of where I'm at and be very patient with people, especially if I can see that the person is like, if they're a new checkout person at the counter or cashier. I do try to be. I do try to be patient and understanding because I would want that, you know, if it were me, I would want someone to extend that to me, you know, with My kids sometimes, you know, it's this, it works both ways too. It's that time of the month, I'm just like, just leave me alone. Or I might have a short temper or a short fuse. So I am conscious of it. I try to be aware of it and try to monitor it. But you know, like anybody, I'm human in their times or I have my days or moments when I could just like ah, go off and just lose it. Well, I haven't really had it, not per se an argument but there's been an ongoing thing with American Express. So I would say because it was not a personal contact but a company, I we it really was an argument but you know, I had some issues with American Express. I had to call in about on I think Saturday and I kept, I wasn't getting the response I expected. And so the whole contact, the call was just back and forth, very frustrating and I was upset and you know, the rep was trying to over talk me then I was trying to over talk her. So you know, I don't know if you would consider that an argument, but I would definitely say that's the last time when you know, I just kind of like reached my bowling point to say the least and was really upset and that was the closest, you know, to an argument and then had to call back this morning. That one didn't really escalate to an argument, but it was a, a tense exchange for a minute or two. A I see. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Probably the most recent contact and that would have been the one on Saturday with American Express or actually it was on Sunday. Yeah. And I know the person was trying to help me but you know, when you, you're constantly being told different things and I've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved. It just takes you there. So just I kept raising my voice, said some things I shouldn't have and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact. I like to really feel in control of the contact and so it just took me there. My blood pressure was raised, excuse me. And I was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe 30 minutes or an hour after that, just irritable and agitated and upset. And so I always try to, you know, go back and pull from those and you know, do my own sense of feedback and see how I could, you know, handle things differently. But that's one I definitely wish I could have kept my cool and been more level headed and, and not really raised my voice and, you know, been more polite. A Okay, tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Well, I probably have had a couple, but probably the most is a situation years ago when I just had my sons and they probably my twins, they were probably about 2, and I was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and it just was not a good time. And he pretty much, you know, was not comfortable with me having another child at the time. And I wasn't comfortable with having another child either, but wanted to keep the baby. But he put me under so much stress and, you know, kind of, I want to say, really pushed me into having. Terminating the. The pregnancy. And that's always stayed with me and I've always missed that pregnancy, that child. I think about that, that baby or what could have been. I try not to hold any anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it, but I know deep downside secretly, if I had it to do all over again, I would have just. I would have kept the baby and move forward. So that would have been probably the hardest, especially emotionally. I could deal with a lot and I have dealt with a lot, you know, being unemployed or, you know, a lot of financial problems, but that to me was the hardest. Thank you. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. No. A How have you been feeling lately? B Okay. You know, I was laid off in December, so I've been constantly trying to do things to, you know, get back on my feet. So that's been a little tough. I've had. I've had to face a lot of challenges and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school. So I've. My range of emotions have just. Have been just that arrange. And a very good friend of mine now who we both started off, you know, in the same place about five years ago, well, she's been able to move forward and go on with her life and now she's graduating in next month from USC with her master's in social work. So I'm feeling a little envious of that. And I have been for like the past year, but more so recently, although I'm very, very happy for her, you know, and she's a good person and she deserves it. But yeah, though of course, deep down inside I wish it was me. So that too has kind of been bothering me. A I understand. B Well, I'm really good with people. I communicate well. I like to talk really good with children. That's why I would like to teach or be a counselor. Although I have not really tapped into it, I know I'm a very creative person. I know I write pretty good. I could possibly be a creative writer, but I know I'm very creative. So if given the opportunity, I know I could tap into that and really develop those skills. Something like with maybe songwriting, fiction writing, probably like interior decorating. Anything artistic, just anything. Because I love music, I love the arts, I love drama, I love plays. I'm not a big fashion buff, but I do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that. So I think those would are my strong points as well as just getting along with people I know I would make a great counselor. People, People. My friends come to me all the time. I have a good ear for listening. I'm a great mediator and I know how to. Because I've been through a lot and one of my friends called me the voice of reason, the one that's actually graduating from sc. But I know I'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom. And I don't know if it has to do with, you know, having older parents myself or how I grew up or at. I had very traditional southern parents who instilled a lot of great values in me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign. I'm a Pisces. But I. I'm really good with people just, you know, period. You know, like I said, I have my moments. But I know if. If it's something I could go into and develop, I would do well. A Is there anything you regret? B Not really. Some of the situations I wish I would have waited to maybe have gotten married before I had children, picked a different partner. And I say that. I mean, my son's father is great, but a great father for my kids, but not so much as a partner for me. We're not together. We haven't been together in years. But I'm just saying overall, I think had I. Yeah, I think I would say if I could let me backtrack that saying not finishing school when I should have and not following my. My dreams and goals and doing things as I kind of was planning initially, and I think that's. That would I honestly be. The one thing I could say I regret is not following my goals and finishing school on time and pursuing what I really wanted to do. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Stay focused and finish school and pick a career path and stay on that and stay motivated. And don't let anything or anybody deter you. I think I'm pretty stable and consistent just with overall, I think, how I face adversity, how I face things. You know, I am a pretty committed person. I try to, you know, if I say I'm gonna do something, I try to stick to it. I'm a very loyal friend, and I'm proud of the fact that I've. I've maintained and done a pretty good job with raising my kids so long. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. B Okay, great. Thank you. A Bye. B Bye.

"There we go. Perfect. Okay, so I'm going to start a virtual human. She will chat with you a little. B ok. Her will say goodbye. She will let you know when you pass. B ok. R and I will put the doorbell here and you can let me know when you are finished. All right? Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine, thank you. A it's good. Where do you come from? B originally, I come. Well, I was born in Mississippi, so I'm from Gulfport, Mississippi. A really? B yes. Why did you move to the? B I had no choice. I was a child. I moved here with my parents. When did you move to the? B when I was two years old. You were very young, right? Yes, I was. I was a young child. R do you travel a lot? B Yes, I like to travel and I travel a lot. What do you like in travel? B being in new environments and new people. Different things. I would like to hear about all your trips. B well, one of my favorite trips was to visit Africa. In, I think that, 2006, I visited West Africa. It was a big trip for me. It was a medical mission where we volunteered and provided medical aid to people. How did you decided to do this? B A friend of mine was actually involved and she told me about getting involved, so I went with her and it started from there. So I don't know. I made the decision this way. Are you happy that you did that? B I am. I am happy to have done that. This is something that I will never forget. A it's so good to hear. What have you studied at school? B I studied English and education so that I can teach high school students? Not currently, no. Well, at the moment, I’m silent privately for a private tutoring company and I'm trying to return to the class by working as a teacher. What is your dream work? B well, everything that combines teaching, travel and writing would be a dream job for me. So, yes, everything that combines these three elements. Teaching has the closest that I have finished. Do you consider yourself an introvert? B from time to time, yes. I don't know. I suppose that compared to others who are considered out of the way and that many people said that I seemed to be reserved or nice o f introverted. I don't know. A good. What do you do to relax? B Well, I don't know. I read. I just started meditation. Try to breathe and calm down. One yeah. All right. What are the things that make you really crazy? B Some things that make me really crazy. Mal treatment of children, abuse of children. R I see what you mean. What do you do when you are annoyed? B Try to understand what generally bothers me, then start from there. If I can control the fact of not being bored, I finally control this, whether or not I am bored. So try to understand what is the problem, then go from there and not be bored if I can help him at all. No, I'm going to control my temperament well, I think. So I don't have. Yeah. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B The last time I argued with someone, I don't know, maybe a few days ago. And. And it was the smell they had on their clothes that I thought was feeling as scent, and they said not. Who sucks. B it's cool. How far are you from your family? B I think I'm very close to my family. We are a fairly close knit family. Talk every day, you see almost every day. A it's great. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B There has been a lot of positive influences in my life. I would say that my aunt and mother were certainly all positive influences. By telling me more about it. B well, I look, me. I look at my aunt. I think it is positive. I look at it because we obviously grew up with very similar history, from very similar neighborhoods and areas, and it has succeeded a lot despite the types of things we have experienced as a child. And she does not let her past define her future. My mother also overcome so many obstacles. She has challenges with her health, but she always tries to be optimistic and she always tries, you know, overcome these things and always live our life despite the physical barriers that she could have. So I look at people capable of not letting their current situation dictate their future, because everything is possible. One yeah. It's great. Have you ever served in the army? B No, I don't have it. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B I. How long have you been diagnosed? B well, I was diagnosed in the past year, then more recently in the last three months. What made you ask for help? B well, fear and just n Or know what to do with some of the things I felt and not know, you know, why I couldn't stop feeling what I felt. There were a lot of symptoms. You know, especially I gained a lot of weight. I couldn't sleep much. And then sometimes I could sleep too much. I sometimes felt sad, as if I wanted to cry a lot. How have you been feeling lately? B I feel good. Have you had days? I don't know. Each day is different, therefore. I mean today I feel good, but as I said, everything is different. And lately, I have felt more like I could be involved in my own life and as I want to go out and do more things. Have you noticed changes in your behavior or your thoughts? B no. No, no. No, I didn't do it. Not different before, which I lived before. Are you going to always in therapy now? B no no. Why did you stop? B well, I received, I suppose, psychotherapy and. I don't know, many things happened. I moved for a while to take care of my grandmother, and I got a little more involved in taking charge of others instead of me for a while. Sometimes. Do you have the impression that therapy is useful? B I do. Yes it is. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B it's a bit difficult. I have either struggled to fall asleep, or stay asleep. I'm sure it is. I do not yet know what it is because me. How do you face them? B Journal, sometimes it could help. If I can write certain things and get it out, it helps. Apart from that, I don't know, you don't know very good ways to face. How are you when you don't sleep well? B tired. Yeah, especially tired. A little confused. A good. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? B I don't know. For the most part, I feel happy. It's just the last time I felt really happy, I guess, during the holidays. To I would love to know more. B I don't know. I suppose that being around family and friends, just the holiday season, I suppose that in general, it was just a happy moment for me. And seeing people that I haven't seen for a while, that's about it. A good. How does your best friend describe you? B How would my best friend describe me? Probably as calm, sometimes cautious, talkative. Sometimes tenacious. I don't know. Many of my friends say they look at me For some of my achievements. And they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because I am attentive and compassionate or easy to speak, that I remind them, I feel like a sister for them. A it's great. Is there anything you regret? B everyone has regrets, I'm sure. Yeah, I guess yes. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. B to relax and be yourself and go for it and. It seems cliché and I don't want to ring this way, but it's true. It's just that you have to learn to be comfortable with you and to relax and know yourself so as not to compare yourself to others. Because what someone else does or where they can be in their life at some point is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you are supposed to do at that time. This does not mean that you are less competent or less able to do so. It just means that everyone has their way and that everyone has sound. Their time and their progress towards the way they get to things. So I said to myself 10 years ago to believe in me and stay on my own way for what I want for my life and that I am not. Yeah, it makes sense. To Tell Me on something you recently did that you really enjoyed. B I really liked working with it. Well, okay. A scientific project with my younger parents, my cousins. We did a scientific project together and it was fun despite the mess that we did. A great. What are you most proud of in your life? B being the first to frequent university in my family, then to go to university and return to the community where I went to school, then to teach in this community and to volunteer in this community and to help young people or children who come from the same environment as I came. So I am very proud to be able to have the opportunity to improve and improve myself, then come back and help someone else improve and improve too. R that looks like an excellent situation. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. B Goodbye. I guess I will press this. Hi.

"A good, great. So she will chat with you a little. In fact, before doing this, one last thing. Perfect. All right. When it has finished, you can press the doorbell. B ok? All right. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B of course. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. A it's good. Where do you come from? B New Jersey. A really? B yes. When did you move to the? B three months ago. How often do you go back to your hometown? B not very often. How does he compare himself to the? B is very different. I don't know, it's many more people here. Why did you move to the? B to start a new life for me. How is you easy to get used to living in Los Angeles? B It was not very easy at all. It was pretty tough at first, but you know, I always try to get used to life here. What are the things you really like at? B I met good friends here. You know, I like the Hollywood region and just, you know, the mountains are beautiful. It's a kind of thing I love. At uh huh. What are the things you really don't like at it? B hmmm, traffic. R I understand. I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B Not really, no, no. One why? B simply did not have time or finances. A good. What are you studying at school? B digital media. Who seems interesting. How did you decided to do this? B well, I always liked, you know, computers and you know, conceiving things and I don't know, I just fell in it. A fee. Do you still do that? B No, I abandoned. A like my work. You could almost say that it is practically made for me. What is your dream work? B well, I guess my dream work would be to work in something for which I went to school. I have never really finished my studies. A but. B I guess it would be great if I returned to school and finished my diploma in the digital media and that I have finished working to do something in this area. Do you consider yourself more shy or out? B a bit of both. You know, I can sometimes be shy, but I like to push myself to get out. You know, it's a kind of fight for me, but I don't want to be, you know, in a shell, so I force myself to b to B E outgoing. One yeah. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B Listen to music. I sometimes drive and, you know, play music in my car, and it helps me relax. A beautiful. B or I smoke a cigarette. Oh, like what? Oh, just heavy metal. That's all I listen to is the metal. A great. How are you going to control your temperament? B well, it depends on the height of my level of stress and anger that I am angry, but I do my best so as not to be as upset. R You discussed someone and what was it? B and I don't know. She. She wanted me to come and get her. She was a little drunk and we just fought on the phone for other things, and I ended up not looking for her because of her attitude on the phone with me. Who sucks. B Yeah, this is the case. R which you feel guilty? B Something that I feel guilty does not often speak to my children, or as often as I should. I was just so busy trying to situate myself here that I don't really have time, you know, to talk to my children as much as I wish. Real, it sounds really difficult. B you have no idea. This is natural, but it is not easy. It is the most difficult work I like to do, but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far. And I made this choice to come here to the, and I feel bad not to see them, you know, but the reason why I came here was to improve so that I could provide them. What is the most difficult thing to be a parent? B fear. You know, fear what. You know, you fear what will happen to your children. You fear that something terrible happens. And not seeing them causes this fear much more, you know, and I can't. I can't always be there with them. I can't see them. You know, it was not as bad when I lived in Florida, and at least I saw them. It was not very often, but I always saw them. Now I don't see them at all. And that's it. This is the most difficult thing I had to do as a parent is to move away from my children, if only temporarily. I don't know how long I will be there for. I don't know what my future has in store for us, but the most difficult thing is to be so far from them. Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. What is the best thing to be a parent? B just the joy they bring me. I mean, I could have a bad day, and they rejoice me right away. I mean, it fears to be far from them for S O Long and they are so far away and do not see their faces, it's the worst thing for all time, you know, but I just like to see their faces. They just give me a smile on my face and. I don't know. What are the ways that you are different as a parent than your parents? B well, I think that the fact that I can go to their level, I am a little more clumsy as a father than my father with me. My father was, you know, strict all the time. Of course, he used to, you know, laugh and play with us, but, you know, he was always very reserved, you know, and he has somehow held a lot of his emotions just because, you know, he was one. He was a strong and very hard guy. But with me, I am very clumsy and silly with my children, and I am strict when I have to be, but I always like to play with them as much as possible. I don't want them to grow too fast. It may have been. Yeah. To tell me of a situation that you. You want you to handle differently. B WOW. A situation that I would have liked to manage differently. There are so many, I guess that when I was still with my ex-wife in Florida. I would have liked not to be so angry or I would have liked not to have left it. Get the best of my emotions. She tended to get under my skin and, you know, continue to pick me up until I explode and I allowed her to do it. You know, I should have moved away when I could and, you know, don't let my temperament take over me. A good. Have you ever served in the army? B no. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. How easy is it for you to have a good night's sleep? B Sometimes it's difficult. Sometimes I just wakened myself up in my bed, you know, thinking of all the things that cross my head, everything, you know, all the stress that I go through with work and, you know, ensuring yourself. I wonder if I'm going. If I will be able to do, you know, rent, you know, asking me what my children are going through, you know, when I see them. Again, if they even care about me, if they even know that they have a father. You know, these are some of the things that cross my head and that stands at night sometimes. R do you think you may be a little hard with yourself? B a little. But you know, I put myself in a situation so, you know, I must be in support, you know, I must harvest what you are sowing, so I have to face it in my own way. R Have you noticed these latest changes in your behavior or your thoughts? B recently tried t o Do not think so much, you know, everything that goes in my life. I try to distract myself and this kind puts me in a better mood. You know, if I spend time with friends or just watch a little television, something to get rid of, you know, all the stresses in my life. A it's good. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B The last time I felt really happy, it was actually a few nights ago. I went out by drinking with some of my friends at work and I don't know, we just turned out to be drunk and that kind of that helped me forget all the bullshit that previously crossed my head. So, if I can distract myself, if I can forget all these other things, then I am happy. At uh huh. What would you say that some of your best qualities are? B Some of my best qualities? I guess I am convincing. A bit like one. I guess you would say, advise some people. You know, some of my close friends, you know, I can talk to people to do things that they can regret or I can, I mean, I'm sorry, to talk about people from things they, you know, can end up regretting or I can, you know, listen to people so that you know, I can say that, you know, you certainly know, listen to them and Disorder as I am living. Can you give me an example? B Who lives in Florida? You know, I speak to him from time to time and he had problems with his girlfriend and you know, I just tell him about his problems and listen to. I listen mainly because, you know, I don't think he has someone else listening. You know, when I lived in Florida, I was very close to him so, you know, he was always counted on me and now that I am here at, I don't want to lose that, you know, connection with him because, I mean, I have always been there for him. So he counts on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice, you know, what I think, you know, he should do. So I think he appreciates this. And I and I'm glad he, you know, count on me for that or that he trusts me enough to tell me all that. A it's great. What are the things you want to change about you? B I don't know. Sometimes I would like me to be so kind or generous. It sounds bad, but sometimes people can enjoy me and I may not realize. And I don't like to say no to people. I always like to please people. So if I can change that, maybe I would have liked not to be such People complain. Did that cause you to trouble? B sometimes. Financially in difficulty? Sometimes. You know, me, you know, help others and, you know, which can make me break sometimes. I may not have enough to pay the bills, but I feel better to help people. I don't know. One yeah. Is there anything you regret? B I regret not having broken with my ex-wife earlier because it put me through so much shit in my life. And I was always trying to be a pleasure. I was trying to please him, you know, trying to please my children as much as possible by breaking, you know, the family. But there is little to take a single person and. And I probably think that if I would have left earlier, I may have been happier and that things may not have become uncontrollable, as they did, you know, during all these years with her. So, if I would have come out earlier, I don't know, I would have been happier, I suppose. A I see. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B It's normal to be selfish. It's good, you know, sometimes think about yourself. You know, if you continue to put everyone in front of you, then you don't think of yourself. You don't think about what makes you happy. Even if people can make you happy, you sometimes have to think about yourself and your needs. Because, you know, you play an important role in the lives of members close to your family. And in order to keep everything afloat, you sometimes have to worry about the only person who, you know, juggle everything with and hold everything, which is yourself. So be a little selfish sometimes. It's good, right? To tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B I don't even know what a weekend is. My ideal weekend would be locked alone in my room, watching movies, listening to music, just with my extinguished mobile phone and not being with anyone or it could be in a bar watching a metal show. So I like to be alone, but sometimes I want to go out with others. I like, you know, to be with people. How would your best friend describe you? B crazy. He thinks I'm. I'm crazy to come here. But I guess you would say that I am devoted and that I am very spirit and that, you know, whatever I think, I can do it, you know, no matter how difficult it is, I will not help. So, I mean, I really respect him for giving me his overview, but I suppose, yes, I suppose you would say that. Crazy but strong in mind. What are you most proud of in your life? B my children. You k Now, it's the only thing that brings me joy, you know, like the real joy is my children. And, you know, the simple fact of having them in my life is the most proud thing I can ever do is just, you know, having them in my life. And although I cannot see them as much, even when I think of them, just thinking, you know, how far they have gone, you know, what they have accomplished in their, you know, in a short time, yes, it makes me happy and I can't wait to see them again. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B One of my most memorable experiences, I guess it would be in Florida, you know, will see our favorite group, Skeleton Witch. And it was an excellent night overall, you know, one of the nights that I will never forget. Just because we have awaited it impatiently, you know, so many months and, you know, when it was finally happened, it was surreal. It was a great night after all, you know, overall, nice. A good. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. B of course. You are welcome. A farewell. B bye. Remove this.

I mean, I don't really like it here that much, but I guess I like that there's, you know, know, still some nature. It's not like New York, like two city, but I guess, you know, it's. It's okay. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B I don't like the traffic. I don't like how crowded it is.

A What did you study at school? B I studied psychology. When I went to smc, I took a psychology class, so I was psychology major.

A What's your dream job? B My dream job would be I would like to help other people. As long as it's something. Helping other people. I would like to help other people with like PTSD and problems and stuff. Yeah. Just as long as I'm, you know, helping other people smile and, you know, relating my problems with other people. A How close are you to your family? B I'm. I'm close. Well, I'm really close with my grandma. My family, it's just we're not like too, too close. They kind of argue a lot. A Okay. B Yeah. A Do you consider yourself an Introvert. B I'm sorry, what's an introvert? Okay, when I'm annoyed, well, I try to relax for a minute. I usually just try to take deep breaths, but it's hard. Yeah, I'm not so good at it. My temper's gotten a little worse. I am not good at all at really controlling my temper. I need some help on that. No, not really. I mean, no, I guess it's not, like, as bad as, like, most people. I've never, like, been in a fight or anything or. Yeah, any of that. I argued with my mom and sister yesterday. It was just something stupid over, like, my sister is sitting. Was sitting in the front seat, and she's a kid, and it's like I'm. I should be in the front seat. So I just asked her sit in the back. And of course, they start, like, yelling and arguing, and it's, like, really annoying. Yeah, it does. Thanks. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B My grandma. She's always giving me encouragement. And she's a therapist, a licensed therapist. So she's always, you know, made it really, really easy for me to have someone to talk to. And I could always go to her. So that helps. Yeah. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B My most memorable experiences? Well, I had one really good experience. I went horseback riding. And that was really, really made me happy. I love horses and nature. That's the biggest thing that I love. And it just made me so happy and so relaxed. So that was a memorable experience. A Awesome. How would your best friend describe you? B Caring. Very caring. Always there to talk to. I don't judge. I never judge. I'm never cranky. I'm never. I never ever get, like, angry at anybody else. Just like my family, you know? But, yeah, just very nice, caring and stuff. A What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? B Things that put me in a good mood. Like music, nature. I like to cook a lot. I like to cook, you know, for my family. Talking puts me in a really good mood. I love meeting new people. Meeting new people puts me in the best mood. A Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Uh, it's not easy. It's hard. Sometimes it's really hard. I don't usually sleep well, so. Yeah, I have trouble falling asleep mostly. A Why? B I guess it's just like my mind will be racing a lot of. You know, sometimes it'll be flashbacks of bad memories just, you know, thinking too much. A Are they triggered by something. B I Don't know. I think just stress, you know, a lot of stress every day. Just everyday stress? Yeah, pretty much that's what triggers it. A How do you cope with them? B I just try to stay positive. I try to think like, okay, well, you know, one day things will get better. I just, I try to call somebody and talk to them if I have trouble. Like my grandma. Yeah, that's good. Thanks. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B When I don't sleep well? Well, I start to like cry a lot and I start to get really irritable. I get really depressed. It makes me not feel well at all. I get very. It just is really, really bad if I don't get sleep. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Yes. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B I was diagnosed three years ago. A What got you to seek help? B I just, I didn't really know what was going on and I realized, okay, well they just diagnosed that and I was like, okay, well this is the problem. And it, I just wanted help because it just. When your mind is after you like that, it's like, it's just awful to have your mind taking control of you like that. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard. A Did you think you had. B Yeah, Yeah. I definitely always thought I had a problem. I always thought something was like really wrong. I just always like kind of nervous around people. Like, I never can really like look anybody in the eye because I'm just so nervous. My eyes are always kind of like racing and I would have sweats if I was in the situation that reminded me of the situation. Like I just try to avoid what reminds me and brings those flashbacks. Yeah. A How have you been feeling lately? B Oh, I've been feeling good. I've been getting out more every day. I'm trying to. I guess walking keeps my mind off my PTSD symptoms. So I'm trying to walk more. That helps. A That's good. B Thanks. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yeah, I have depression. Yeah, it helps. Yeah, it actually does help me a lot. I currently don't have one right now. I'm actually getting a new one in a few days though. Like it's kind of a mix up. But yeah, it really, really helps me. A What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going? B I noticed that I've had less flashbacks and I've been more relaxed, I guess. And yeah, just, you know, trying to keep more occupied. Yeah, it helps. A That's good. When was the last time you felt really happy? B The last time I felt really Happy, I guess. I don't know today, because, I mean, I'm glad to be part of this. A What are you most proud of in your life? B Most proud of? Well, trying to think of what I'm most proud of. I think I'm most proud of, like, the fact that I am able to, you know, not be like. Well, I mean, most people I know, they, like, deny that they have a problem. And I'm proud that I can actually, like, you know, be a person who can realize, okay, I have a problem and I need help. But a lot of the people I know, they don't take medication, they're untreated, and they just don't want to get any help. And I'm glad to get help because I don't want to feel that way, and I want to get help for the problem instead of feel that. A That's good. Is there anything you regret? B Oh, gosh, there's a lot I regret. Yeah, there's a lot I regret. You know, Drug abuse, you know, but that's part of, you know, the ptsd. I regret a lot. Mistakes, you know, relationships, stuff like that. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Wow. I would have told myself to. I guess the advice I would have given myself was to try to keep my mind more relaxed, I guess. Yeah. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B Well, I'm a very nice person, and I always like to smile. People are always saying how I smile a lot, but the smile, I guess it kind of hides, like, what's on the inside. But, you know, I'm pretty depressed, you know, but I just try to keep smiling. And I always like to lend a hand to help and make people feel better. A Okay. What are some things you like to do for fun? B For fun? I like to go to the mall. That's a lot of fun. I like to go to the mall. I like to go out with my grandma. We go places, go shopping.

"To there you are. B I don't seem beautiful? Let me straighten a little here. A good. C so I'm just going to do something that flows our equipment. A good. C now you will chat with her a little. And then when you're done, I'm going to give you the doorbell and I'm going to put it there. When she says you have finished talking, you. If you just want to ring it. To let me know. B agree, great. A thank you. B mm. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started and do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B pretty well. I feel good. Los Angeles, California. Here. MM. One of the rare natives of Los Angeles. What are you doing now? B i homeschool my 10 year old son and I am a housewife. I have five children and got married 22 years. So it's a full -time job, huh? R do you travel a lot? B a little. We went to Israel about two months ago for a pilgrimage with our church. Yeah. So I would say yes, I have traveled a little. Well, more recently, we love 2 months ago, we went to Israel for a pilgrimage. We left for about nine days and it was fabulous. It was. We spent the first five days in Khorazim, which is near Galileo and in a place called. I mean, the name of the region is Chorazim. But we stayed in a place called the Dome of Scalilea, which is a house that welcomes Christian pilgrims as well as Jewish pilgrims. A it's so good to hear. What do you like on travel? B I appreciate, as the most important thing I love, it is like meeting people and of course, seeing history, especially Israel. I mean, it's totally old. But most of them like, these are people. I think of better understanding how the different cultures live. A good. Do you consider yourself introverted? B No, not at all. One why? B I don't know, you know, all my life that I have always been open and. And willing to socialize. And I remember that my younger brother was still joking, saying that I would talk to anyone and that I will do it, I will talk to anyone just because I like to learn others. What are you doing to relax. B Most of the time? At the end of the day, after preparing dinner and we dined together with the family. There is a word play on the computer that I like to play for a Shortly, then watch TV, take a cocktail with my husband and relax. This is what we do. And you know, because we have a lot, we are not too late. So I like to look at criminal dramas. A beautiful. What are the things that make you really crazy? B really crazy? Probably not much of which I am frustrated. For example, my daughter does not clean her room almost never. So it makes me angry. But in terms of similar to get really angry, I mean, apart from the little things my children do, you know, in particular my older child who is 21, you know, he can be conflict. So, other than that, nothing really makes me angry. I didn't feel that. What is the best thing to be a parent? B contributing to the company, helping to raise responsible people, I suppose. And of course, love and affection and, pleasure and excitement that go with and all the stages that go. I mean as really right now, I'm in a stage where my children are adults or adolescents. I have only, I have an 11 year old child and the others are all adolescents and adults. So it's really fun because we can talk about current events and all kinds of things that happen in the world and you know, have, have, have difficult discussions and that kind of thing. It is therefore a different level from that when you take care of babies and you know, changing diapers and that kind of things. The most difficult is that it is 24 7, you are never a parent, you know, and you must therefore accept it. And that's. I remember when I first, with my first child, thinking when I brought him back to the hospital house, that's all. I mean, there is no going back. You cannot change. I mean, I guess you could if you were doing something horrible, but I mean, in normal circumstances, you cannot change that. And it is a permanent thing and in some respects, it removes your freedom, but in other respects, it gives you a kind of different freedom. R I see what you mean. There are always orders in life, right? B mm, always. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B I'm sorry, I didn't have what you said. Some of the things that have had a positive influence in my life, especially my church and my faith. But also my husband, he was really one, he is a bit, he is very like a logical thought and very you know, anchored. So, if I become emotional or if I get angry for something, it is always. We will balance each other. Likewise, if he gets angry for something, I I am able to balance it. So it was one. It was a great gift in my life. How are you? B I don't do it. I don't think I would be classified like someone with a temperament. Occasionally, I sometimes get angry, but I don't have, like, like, I rarely have explosions. I'm more. More likely to, you know, to say what I feel, not to let it accumulate. So you know, as my husband and I do not rarely fight, like, arguments that are, you know, shout and shout or something like that. It almost never happens because, as I said, I am more of a type of person who communicates on the spot. So, if I think of something, I generally communicate it right away instead of letting it accumulate. A it's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B Usually, I have my eldest son because he, you know, he thinks he knows everything. He is 21 years old, so he has the mentality of knowing everything, and I simply tell him that he does not know everything. And, you know, as life continues, he will learn more. And it is very confident and very yourself. What is the word? Assured self-assured. And so he thinks that, you know, everything he does is correct, and he still has a lot of learning to do. That's it. Who seems really difficult. B mm. It can be. MM. What do you think of today's children? B I think that many of them are spoiled and live in an instant gratification environment, which, I think, will harm the. In the future of this country. But given that with all the technology we have, there is really no way to go back. So I have the hope that they will do it. I mean, I think this country has been built on hard work and ethics, and I hope that the next generation and generations thereafter can maintain this standard of living. I don't know if it is possible. How would your best friend describe you? B as a loving, stimulating, funny. We laugh a lot. And interesting and honest things that. I mean, my best. I have. Well, in fact, my best friend is. It's two people. These are two sisters with which I grew up, and us. For a few years, I took care of their mother who has Alzheimer's disease, before my parents fell ill. So I had a very close. Have a very close relationship with them. Always do it. And so I am considered the fourth sister. So I would say that these are my best friends and we love each other very much. It's a good relationship. Have you ever served in the army? B no. Have you ever received a diagnosis of PTS? B no. Yes, especially half. Depression. It was more anxiety for Obvisible. It probably is five or six years. I mean I did it and in all my life, but it was never diagnosed originally as in adolescence, I think I think I started with anxiety. But other than that, me, you know, so depression goes with anxiety if it is not under control. But now it's under control. So I have a great. Eh. No, I think that's what they call free floating anxiety. More organic reasons for this. In other words, there was a chemical imbalance in my brain. I actually felt good. The holidays were great. We had good family meetings. A little stressed because we are making a big decision at the moment to help my parents get out. My father is really sick and we offered to move with them. They have a big house, but we had to do a lot of renovation and others to help and some of course moving. And so we are prey to this and it is therefore a big and big change. But I can't wait to be there because I really don't want my parents to be alone. As they get it. They were in the 80s, so as they get closer to death, I want to have my family there. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B not easy. All my life, I think I still have, I mean that I have always had. At least, I wake up at least once in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. And other than that, I mean, no, now I sleep well. I mean, other than that, I sleep well. But sometimes, if I wake up like really, really early in the morning, then I can't fall asleep. I'm going to get up and maybe do work on the computer, then go back to bed and go back to sleep. It depends on my schedule and if children should be at school early and there are many factors. Yeah, sometimes it is. How are you when you don't sleep well? B probably fundamentally the same. I think I could complain a bit like, oh, I'm tired or my body hurts or anything, you know. But I think that overall, I'm probably the same. My children know. I will tell my children, oh, I am really tired and they will understand. As my eldest daughter will be very useful and maybe my other girl will try to prepare dinner or something like that. So you know, they can start a little more. You have noticed changes in your. B not really, no. Not really. Nothing significant, huh? In fact, yes, I do it. I have the impression that therapy is useful. Well, we had a situation with my daughter. She also suffers from anxiety and we have had it in therapy for some time ND, we are recently about to finish a group with it. He was a six -month group for DBT, his name is. And it's like one. This is the first time that they have document use with adolescents. And it was really good. It was very, very useful. It's just about living in the moment and how, you know, real physical and mental strategies to keep your. You prevent your mind from going crazy, you know, worry about things or you know, in this case, some children have tried to injure themselves or anything. It is therefore the object of therapy. And it was really good. My husband and I went both to our daughter and it was really, really informative and really useful. I think it's so good to hear. Oh, my daughter was. She was in the wrong direction. She suffered a lot and we knew it and we knew it and we acted on it. That's it. A it's great. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? B as really happy and happy? I would probably say. I mean it would probably be in Israel when we have renewed our wedding wishes in Cana. So you know where Cana's wedding took place. It was really moving and beautiful and it had happened that our birthday was. We left on the day of our birthday. We took the plane for Israel. So it was just at the same time. It was beautiful, very significant. And apart from that, I would say, you know, like other joyful occasions have been, you know, like Christmas and you know, family gatherings and you know, my father's birthday, he was 83 years old, you know, that kind of thing. This is an interesting question. I would say once I do things that I have to do, as if I have a lot, a lot of work to do in the house or races to run, once I do them, I feel like a feeling of accomplishment, you know, a bit like, I mean that I have worked for many years like a month of administrative management in UCLA and that you have, once you have done things to do. There is this feeling of like, yes, I did it, you know, so I think it would be, you know, for me, the most recent way of feeling good and feeling, you know, as, you feel accomplished. What is your dream work? B Dream Job? I think I have already experienced it. I am also a doula by birth and. Yeah. And so I attended a lot of births and now I only really do it for family and friends. And this is the most rewarding thing you can ask to involve d in is birth, the implementation of a new life in this world. So I would say it was probably my. It was a dream work and I didn't know. I trained a lot after, you know, I did my management stuff and it was and was great. So I no longer work in a hospital. In fact, the hospital in which I worked is now closed. But as I said, I do it for family and friends. I attended a birth of one of my friends by accident. She had the same OB as me with all my children. And I came to bring food to her husband when she was in work. We were close friends. His work resumed a little when I arrived. She wanted me to stay, she didn't want me to go. I hadn't planned that. It was therefore the first birth to which I attended outside of me giving birth, which is a completely different experience. So, after that, I was really interested in possibly studying a midwife. But then, I discovered this thing called Vingadula, which really gives you much more hands, one. On contact with the patient, that's what I like. So I trained to do so in an Inglewood hospital about 15 years ago because my son was 15 years old and he was a year old. No, 16 years ago. SO. Yeah. And I was. How difficult? B well, it can be difficult in terms of hours. It depends on the duration of women at work. And you also know, for me, I always say to my friends and family if they want me to be their doula, that I cannot guarantee 100% that I do not do it for business. And in this way. And because of this, I do not have like backup doubles that, in case I am sick or that I am not available, someone else could replace for me. SO. But so far, it is that all the women who have asked me, I have been there for any reason. So the, the. The only one I missed was one of my church friends who wanted me to accept her second baby. I was with her for her first, but her work went so quickly, she didn't even called me. It was in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of work. She would. Even if she had called me, I would have been there in time. So went very quickly. But other than that, you know. Yes, I was able to attend all the births of people who asked me to do. Throughout life or in your work, probably my own birth. I mean, the birth of my own children. How did you feel at that time? B like, there is an extremely feeling of joy, excitement, relief, because of course, you are out of pain. And then, as, it's just a question, you know, go forward from there. But it's like something you can't explain. It's fair. It's great after giving birth. And I lived in both directions. I made both natural. And my last test was by a section C, so I had the two experiences with my third child. I had a kind of crazy nurse. She was a bit psychotic, but other than that. We laugh now, but when I was in work, it was not funny. And her. She was not there when the doctor. I mean, my third child was born very quickly after having broken the water and woof. My husband was there, but she was not, any more than the doctor. And she had a lot of problems because I only had two contractions after that and my daughter was born in bed. So for me, it was great because I didn't have to go through another job. But I'm sure they were not happy. They have to fill a lot of paperwork after that. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. B Now? Will I give myself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago, I was probably more. Not as relaxed, not like. Like, I now think of my age that I do not have the same concerns as me. I don't worry. I do not worry at all what people think of me. I don't worry at all, you know, like, I noticed my daughters, oh, mom, you can't wear that. Because people. People will say that. I say that I don't care, but they do it because it is always in their state of mind that, oh, mom, you have to dress like that or dress like that or something else. It would probably be that, the wisdom you make with the age you see how life. There are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things. What are you most proud of in your money? B the most proud? Probably my family, my husband and my children. I mean, the fact that we have stayed married, that we are an intact family, that my children see every day how their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents, and they really express their gratitude that we are married and we know, we are always a family. So I would say that is probably that. Probably it. One of my best qualities is to be able to listen to people and not be a criticism. Over the years, I have had a lot of experience with people with problems, many friends with problems, people I know about church. And he just taught me that everyone has weaknesses, everyone has problems and I don't think I'm better than someone else. If you think you ""Is better than someone else, so it's generally true me. A sign that you do not know yourself well enough. All right. A good. I think I asked for everything I need. B ok. A farewell. B Goodbye.

"A good, great. Okay, so let me check your microphone. I think it looks good. B oh. A now, I'm going to ring you. B ok. R When she, when she is finished, will make you know and you can press this button. B ok? A thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yeah. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. A it's good. Where do you come from? B Burbank, California. A really? B yeah. What are the things you really like at? B The weather, of course. I think everyone loves time. It's not too city like Chicago or New York. It's pretty big. We have beaches. We are not landlocked. What are the things you don't really like at it? B Sometimes smog, traffic. The fact that I have just been here like all my life. A good. I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B not enough as I would like. I go to school in Chicago and I went to New York several times. San Francisco. And I did a road trip through the country that was cool. I have seen some states. What do you like in travel? B See new places, go to benchmarks that I have read or saw only photos. To I would love to hear about one of your trips. B I traveled from Los Angeles to Chicago by taking Route 66. And the best part was to see the Grand Canyon for the first time. It was the coolest thing I have ever seen. Probably great. How did you feel at that time? B happy. And then just happy. It was beautiful. It was nice. I haven't felt like this for a long time. A it's so good to hear. What have you studied at school? B I studied the film. A fee. How did you decided to do this? B This is just something that I have always loved as long as I remember. And when came the time to start applying in schools, I didn't know what I wanted to do and I applied to Northwestern as a student in cinema and it ended up being the right decision. A it's great. What is your dream work? B Ooh, I like to make movies, but part of me really likes to make people laugh and be in front of the camera. So, an actor, a comic actor would be totally great, but it's difficult. You consider you F more shy or outgoing? B I'm super outgoing and I really like to talk to people. I like to be the center of attention generally. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I like to watch insane television, like toddlers and tiaras and the Duck dynasty. Just television programs where I really don't have to be careful at all. A good. How are you going to control your temperament? B I agree. I really become emotional very quickly, but I am generally able to keep my anger and not, like, like the others and all that, for the most part. Did that cause you to trouble? B Sometimes, I arrive, like arguments and beats with my friends and people who are important to me very easily. And I hate apologizing to people, so the fights could last long enough. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B My best friend, Ryan, I think. And it was our relationship and the way we somehow spoiled it and crossed a few lines and where. How we were going to come back to the way it was before. How difficult? B really hard. It is. It's my best friend, and I'm missing, but we have spoiled, and it's right. It's not the same thing. It's like, not the same friendship. A I am sorry. B me too. To tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B too much. Um. I guess when I have a boyfriend and it's a girlfriend, which was not going well. I would have liked to realize that it was bad and that you would have simply stopped there and would not have let him continue for weeks, which led to my breakup, then our friendship was really spoiled. R could you have done something to avoid it? B I guess not. Spend as time with him as I am. Be more assertive. To Tell Me on the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. B I guess it was in November. I was very depressed and suicidal, so I told my friend what I felt and that she needed to take me to the emergency room. And from emergencies, I had the choice, I don't know, I guess that I go home or be sent to a psychiatric hospital. And even if I felt as if I had no choice, I knew it was my choice, and I decided to go to the psychiatric hospital, which was, like the worst experience of my life. Can you tell me? Hobo. God was horrible. It was in Chicago, and it was frightening, and I didn't know anyone, and they take, as, take all your things and they put you in scrubs, and they just start Givi NG you medication, and you are essentially left to your own devices. There were only three group therapy sessions a day, and everyone, there were above all men, and they were all really old, and it was frightening. I didn't know anyone. Everyone. Most people were not depressed. They were violent. So it was quite frightening. And I'm just. It was really difficult for me. What decided you to do this? B I had been so depressed for, like a month. I stopped going to my lessons and working, and I told my teachers of lies about being sick, and I kept calling the sick to work. I dropped a lesson, and I was dripping at my lessons and I was not turning in any work, and I did not speak to any of my friends, and I was drinking a lot and I spent and vomited everywhere, and I was just in a very bad place. And when I was finally going to kill myself, I realized that I needed help. Who seems really difficult. B It was. What made you ask for help? B UM, I had severe depression when I was a younger teenager, and I tried to kill myself at the time. And I was put in therapy for a while. So I told myself that I no longer want to take this bad path. I just want to get better. So I had to do it. I had to get help. Are you going to always in therapy now? B I do. I go once a week. Do you have the impression that therapy is useful? B I have the impression that if you have the right therapist, it's really useful. I had a therapist that I really liked, and I thought we could have gone very far. But unfortunately, she is back in Chicago and I am in Los Angeles. So I have to do it. I have to settle for this new therapist. And she's fine. It is not. We are not very great together, but it is what I have right now. It's better than nothing. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B not so easy at all. One why? B since I got out of the hospital and I started and I started medication for my depression, I just couldn't sleep. GOOD. Falling asleep is difficult. Stay asleep is hard. Have really crazy and lively dreams that wake me up and are disturbing. One like what? B UM, I suppose that sometimes they reflect things that worry me in my life, but it is only. They are frightening and they seem so real that sometimes I wake up and I have to ask my mother, as, we went here. Have we done this? Did it really happen? And it's usually not. You dream that sometimes I am so frightened. I, like, speak in my sleep and I wake up. R when is the last time that happened? B as there are probably two nights. A wow. Tell me about th The last time you felt really happy. B This is a difficult question. I think that in November, after getting out of the hospital, I finally had a good day and my friend took me to the city center of Chicago and we went to the Sears tower and I was able to look at these large windows on which you go out and see the city. And it was really cool. How would your best friend describe you? B UM, probably super outgoing, likes to be the center of attention. Funny and a little crazy. Is there something you regret? B I try not to regret things in my life. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B I would say that life is worth it. And don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Don't wait until it gets really bad. To tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B I guess my ideal weekend would be to sleep, then catch a film with my friends, maybe get home with them and cook cookies, eat all cookies, watch TV, take a pajamas evening, then, like making pancakes in the morning and watch more movies. We are watching a lot of films. I would like to do this during my free time. Go for a walk, I don't know, go to the beach. This is a difficult question. I mean, I think I have done a lot of great things in my life and I have done a lot. But I think one of the most proud things, the most proud moments of my life is something really small and insignificant. I was doing this exercise, the training camp and the last person to cross the finish line was to make 30 pumps. And he was a guy. I didn't know him at all. And the coach said: Does anyone want to help him? If someone helps him, you need to make half of everyone. And no one wanted to help him. And then I just decided to start making pumps with him. And I'm just. It was not because I wanted to get credit or because I thought it would make me look good. I just did it. And nobody really knows it, but that's right. I feel really good about it. A it's great. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with it. B It was nice to meet you. Bye.

"A Okay. Okay. B All right. So now I'm going to put this doorbell right over here again. When she's done, she'll let you know and then you can press this button to let me know. Okay? A Okay. B Thank you. A Okay. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me any. Anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Yes. B Okay. So how are you doing today? A I'm alright. B That's good. Where are you from originally? A South. La. B Really? What are some things you really like about la? A The weather, the women, the opportunities. That's about it. B What are some things you don't really like about la? A Racism. Police brutality. Injustice. Yeah, that's it. B I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? A No. B Why? A Not much of a exploring type of person. B Okay. What'd you study at school? A Psychology. Mm. B How did you decide to do that? A It was one of the classes I excelled in the most. So I decided to change it from business to psychology. B Are you happy you did that? A Yeah. Yes. B Are you still working in that? A No. B What's your dream job? A To own my own record label. B Nice. How hard is that? A It's moderately hard, but you know, take it one day at a time. Just, I guess, you know, stay focused. B Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A A little bit of both. B Why? A I tend to be shy in situations I'm not comfortable with or I'm new to. And I'm outgoing in places I'm more comfortable with. B Uh huh. A Yeah. B Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? A Turn the lights down low and listen to soft music. B That's good. How are you at controlling your temper? A I'm getting better over the years. I think I'm pretty decent now compared to how I used to be. B Has that gotten you in trouble? A Yes, ma'am. B Can you tell me about that? A Due to the lack of, I guess you could say controlling my emotions, I have got. Incarcerated. Sent to prison? Yeah. B Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. A I'm not sure. I don't really have a recollection of My hardest decision I've made in my life. B When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? A It was probably a few days ago with the girl I was talking to, and I was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness. Yeah. B How did you feel in that moment? A Frustrated. Because, you know, you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect, you know, the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship. Then at the same time, when you. When you have expectations, sometimes you kind of set yourself up for failure. So, you know, I guess I'm just learning. B Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. A There's a lot of situations I would handle differently. Probably the most recent was I had got into a physical altercation with an inmate when I was incarcerated. And that made me. That's what sent me to prison. And. And I had to do a lot more time. And if I handled it differently, I probably would have never went to prison, and I probably would have been home a lot sooner than originally happened. Yeah. B Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. A There are several events I wish I could erase from my memory. Probably my first girlfriend. She did something really extreme. It wasn't necessary in my eyes, and it could have cost me my life. I think that that's a recurring thought that I wish I could completely erase my memory along with the good memories as well. A few fights, I guess you could say. Shootouts, getting jumped, getting robbed. You know, those things, I think those inhibit me, I guess, to explore certain areas of life that I'm not comfortable with. So those are the few things that it'll be nice if I could erase it completely. B Yeah. That sounds really hard. A Yeah. B What's something you feel guilty about? A Hurting people that didn't need to be hurt emotionally, especially. A few women in my life are in my past. Probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through, along with my close friends and family as well. B Tell me about your relationship with your family. A It used to be rocky growing up, but as I got older and matured, and the certain experiences that I've been through kind of brought me closer to my family. So now it's. It's pretty decent. It's pretty decent. B That's great. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? A I would say my mother. Yeah, my mother. B Can you tell me about that? A Um, well, she had her share of experiences, negative and positive. I admire her the struggles she's been through. She experienced difficult economic hardships growing up, but that didn't stop her from raising a son at a young age, finishing school, getting her master's and just overall being a good person. And she also battled mental health issues as well. And probably not the best of family that she could have been raised with. So she's kind of like a inspiration to me and other people as well. So I would say my mother. B How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? A It's not easy. So, yeah, it's not easy. B Why? A I couldn't tell you. I. I've always had sleeping issues. I used to just take like over the counter sleep medication or Nyquil, but it makes you drowsy the next morning. So it's like. It's a negative effect. Really. Yeah. B Are you triggered by something. A The medica? I don't know. I don't know. But I just stopped taking it because I didn't like feeling drowsy. B How have you been feeling lately? A Not good at all. B Can you tell me about that? A Yeah. I mean, I recently got released from prison not too long ago. I'm older now and a lot more responsibilities and I feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be. I feel like I could have made a lot more better decisions in my life, you know, sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just things that I've been through and the whole nine yards. So, yeah, I'm sorry. It's all good. B There are always trade offs in life, aren't there? A Yep. This is true. B Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? A Yes. B How long ago were you diagnosed? A About two and a half, three years ago. B What got you to seek help? A Myself. I was just tired of not. I don't know, I guess school kind of made me seek help because I started to understand myself, how my brain works, you know. So I decided to seek help maybe to better my life. Yeah, you could say that. B Are you happy you did that? A Yes, I am. B Do you still go to therapy now? A Yes. B Do you feel like therapy is useful? A Yes, I do, actually. I do. B What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? A Better decision making, better tools to reflect on choices, how to control certain situations better. Yeah. B Can you give me an example of that? A Well, instead of just always reacting on emotion, no matter what kind of emotion it is, I step back and assess the situation, you know, to see what's the best way to react towards the situation. And by doing that, it has made Me more mature, emotionally more mature and just has a positive outcome. B Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. A I was laying next to a beautiful woman who cared about me and the feeling was mutual. So that was probably the most happy. B How would your best friend describe you? A Oh my goodness. Spontaneous, outgoing. Sometimes a little crazy fun. That's about it. B What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? A Nothing. B Is there anything you regret? A Like I said earlier, just, you know, hurting the few women that were in my life, my past and my friends and family. That's about it. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A Oh, shit. School was really important. How I carry myself, the people who I surround myself with, and what I choose to do in my free time. Those are the few things I would tell myself. B What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? A Good music, a good game of basketball. Sex. B Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. A Well, I like going out. I like going to parties, social gatherings where everyone's friendly and there's no drama. That's what I like. Dancing, beautiful women, couple drinks. That's about it. B What are you most proud of in your life? A I guess not necessarily giving up and just. I don't know, just keep going. Just not giving up. Really? Yeah. B Okay. I think I've lost everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. A Bye. Bye.

Whoa. A There it goes. There it goes. B Okay, great. A Now we can get started. When this is finished, can you just ring the doorbell and let me know? Yeah. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? B I'm doing good. A Where are you from? B Originally from Los Angeles, California. A Nice. What are some things you really like about la? B The cool weather, the beaches, the people, the school. Schools. A What do you study at school? B Child development. A Nice. Are you still doing that? B Yes. A What's your dream job? B To be a teacher for special education. A How hard is that? B It's not hard because I love to work with children. A Really? B Yes. A What are some things that make you really mad? B Dishonesty, maybe. A Can you give me an example of that? B Like if a guy, like. Especially when it comes to relationships, when they lie to you about something that's very minimal. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My mom. B I want to see my mom. A Aw. How close are you to them? B I'm very close. We talk every day. A That's so good to hear. How close are you to your family? B Very close. Even though I don't live with them, I try to see them as much as I can. A How do you like your living situation? Uh, it's okay. B It's. It's cool. It's fine. A Do you have roommates? B Yes, I do. A Tell me more about that. B Um, they're. They're friendly. It's just that they're very quiet, so I'm not used to that environment. A Oh. What's it like for you living with them? B It's fine. Like, the. How much it costs is very cheap, so that's good. And they're friendly, so it's fine. I just wish it was a little bit. It could have been better. So. Yeah. A Could you have done anything to avoid it? B Yes. A Could you say a little more about that? B I had a different option to live with somebody else, and I'm still friends with the female. And Comes to find out that we connect more than the roommates that I live with. So I kind of regret moving in with the roommates I have now versus who I was supposed to move in with in the beginning. But I'm stuck for a year. So it's. Whatever, that's fine. A How do you know them? B How do I know who? A Let's come back to that. One minute. B Yeah. A What are some things that make you really mad? B There's nothing that really gets me really mad that I could think of on top of my head. A Whatever comes to your mind. B Maybe when it comes to schools, how they treat the children, especially children of color, maybe that's what gets me mad. A Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? B Yes. A Why? B Because I do things from within. I guess I'm internally motivated to do things, I guess. Yeah. A Do you feel that way often? B Yeah. A Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Wow. I hardly ever argue with somebody. A Really? B Yeah. Oh, my sister, I guess my sister. That was about a month ago. A How did you feel in that moment? B I felt very betrayed and belittled because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be disrespecting me in any type of way because I'm an adult. So, yeah, I was not feeling the situation at all. A Can you tell me about that? B Just her getting into grown folks business. And it was a conversation between me and my mother, and I guess she overheard what was being said and she felt like through my actions that I was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the case. But because she didn't know the whole situation, she just automatically assumed and put stuff on Facebook about me disrespecting me, calling me out my name, and it was. Yeah. So. And she didn't come to me about it. Like, she just did all this other stuff on Facebook. I don't. That's one thing I don't like either, is when you hate indirect comments. Like, if you have. If you need to talk to me, come directly to me. Don't put it on Facebook, Tell other people. That's a pet peeve of mine. I really don't like that. A Yeah, that sucks. B Yeah. So. But I mean, we're fine now, so that's good. A That's so good to hear. B Yeah. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B To not believe people so easily. So gullible. To not be so gullible. A Okay, tell me more about that. B I guess that I've been hearing that lately. How I believe anybody. Anything that somebody says without really thinking about it or without having them prove it. So I guess you could say I made a lot of mistakes. I don't want to say I regretted it because I'm glad I went through it while I was younger than me getting older and going through the same situation. So, Yeah, I believe people too easily, and I give people too many chances, so. Yeah. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B When I went on a cruise, which was a happy experience, when I went on a cruise to Mexico with my family when I was 16, about six years ago. A Wow. B Yeah. A That's a long time. B Yeah. I mean, yeah, I guess. A Do you travel a lot? B No. I really want to, though. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Trying new things, seeing new views of the world, trying the different type of foods, seeing how the government is and how they run the things out there. I guess I'd love to hear that on your trips. Yeah. I plan to go to the Bahamas next year. I plan to do a lot of traveling last year, actually, so. Yeah. A Is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B It's pretty good, somewhat. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B I'm tired, and I kind of fall asleep during class and whatnot. A Do you feel that way often? B Yeah. It's my fault, though. A When was the. When was the last time that happened? B Probably today. A Wow. B Yeah. A Why? B Well, I fell asleep late, so it's my fault. A Okay. Do you feel down? B No, I feel pretty happy right now. A That's good. Mm. Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you ever served in the military? B No. A Okay. How would your best friend describe you? B Very friendly and funny. Talkative. How do you know them through high school. A How close are you to them? B We're pretty close. We try to talk as often as possible, maybe once a week. Try to see them at least every few months. A That's good. What do you think of today's kids? B They're everywhere. Yeah. No comment off of that. They're more smarter. They are learning more stuff than what we learned back in the day. They are learning. They're very progressing. But when it comes to technology, they're not outside. They're always on the computer, on their phones. They don't play outside no more. They don't care about nature or about the little things in life. They just. Yeah. But when it comes to their mentality, they are getting smarter because the schools are getting better. I ain't gonna lie. So yeah. A When was the last time that happened? B When what happened? A I'm not sure. Let's come back to that later. When was the last time you felt really happy? B Last weekend, I guess. I'd love to hear all about it right now. What did I do? Being on my boyfriend makes me really happy. So I was just hanging out with him last weekend and I never really get to see him that much, so. Yeah. A Why? B Cause he works. I. I have school, different schedules. A That sounds really hard. B It's not that bad. A How do you know them? B He's my boyfriend. I've been knowing him for about, what, six months now? We met through a mutual friend in LA Ida. A Awesome. Okay. I think I've lost everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B You're welcome. A Goodbye. B Bye. That's not supposed to happen. No. A How long has it been? B The whole time. But I was able to talk to her. A Okay, good. I'm so sorry. B It's fine. Was she moving around and stuff? A Was she. B No, she just wanted to stay right there, so. A Okay. Sorry. B I wasn't sure if that was part of it or not. Sorry about that. A Weird. Okay, let's go ahead and shut this down.",0,perfect okay move around littl bit xbox kinect sens want move b littl bit danc around see stick figur b oh okay whoa goe goe b okay great get start finish ring doorbel let know yeah thank hi elli thank come today creat talk peopl safe secur environ think friend judg ca comput learn peopl would love learn ask question get us start pleas feel free tell anyth answer total confidenti today b good b origin lo angel california nice thing realli like la b cool weather beach peopl school school studi school b child develop nice still b ye dream job b teacher special educ hard b hard love work children realli b ye thing make realli mad b dishonesti mayb give exampl b like guy like especi come relationship lie someth minim someon posit influenc life mom b want see mom aw close b close talk everi day good hear close famili b close even though live tri see much like live situat uh okay b cool fine roommat b ye tell b um friendli quiet use environ oh like live b fine like much cost cheap good friendli fine wish littl bit could better yeah could done anyth avoid b ye could say littl b differ option live somebodi els still friend femal come find connect roommat live kind regret move roommat versu suppos move begin stuck year whatev fine know b know let come back one minut b yeah thing make realli mad b noth realli get realli mad could think top head whatev come mind b mayb come school treat children especi children color mayb get mad okay consid introvert b ye b thing within guess intern motiv thing guess yeah feel way often b yeah okay last time argu someon b wow hardli ever argu somebodi realli b yeah oh sister guess sister month ago feel moment b felt betray belittl littl sister disrespect type way adult yeah feel situat tell b get grown folk busi convers mother guess overheard said felt like action choos somebodi els famili even case know whole situat automat assum put stuff facebook disrespect call name yeah come like stuff facebook one thing like either hate indirect comment like need talk come directli put facebook tell peopl pet peev mine realli like yeah suck b yeah mean fine good good hear b yeah advic would give 10 20 year ago b believ peopl easili gullibl gullibl okay tell b guess hear late believ anybodi anyth somebodi say without realli think without prove guess could say made lot mistak want say regret glad went younger get older go situat yeah believ peopl easili give peopl mani chanc yeah one memor experi b went cruis happi experi went cruis mexico famili 16 six year ago wow b yeah long time b yeah mean yeah guess travel lot b realli want though enjoy travel b tri new thing see new view world tri differ type food see govern run thing guess love hear trip yeah plan go bahama next year plan lot travel last year actual yeah get good night sleep b pretti good somewhat like sleep well b tire kind fall asleep class whatnot feel way often b yeah fault though last time happen b probabl today wow b yeah b well fell asleep late fault okay feel b feel pretti happi right good mm diagnos depress b ever diagnos ptsd b ever serv militari b okay would best friend describ b friendli funni talk know high school close b pretti close tri talk often possibl mayb week tri see least everi month good think today kid b everywher yeah comment smarter learn stuff learn back day learn progress come technolog outsid alway comput phone play outsid care natur littl thing life yeah come mental get smarter school get better ai gon na lie yeah last time happen b happen sure let come back later last time felt realli happi b last weekend guess love hear right boyfriend make realli happi hang last weekend never realli get see much yeah b caus work school differ schedul sound realli hard b bad know b boyfriend know six month met mutual friend la ida awesom okay think lost everyth need okay thank share thought b welcom goodby b bye suppos happen long b whole time abl talk okay good sorri b fine move around stuff b want stay right okay sorri b sure part sorri weird okay let go ahead shut
"A There I am. B If you can just move your arms just a little bit and see a little stick figure pop up. There it is. A Why does she look like someone I know? Sorry. No problem. B I think that's probably good. A Okay. Okay. B Thank you. A Alrighty. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Yes, I'm okay. B So how are you doing today? A I'm good. I'm a little tired, but I'm good. B That's good. Where are you from originally? A Michigan. I'm from Michigan. B When did you move to la? A A long time ago. Then I left once, twice a year. B How does it compare to la? A Cold. Very cold. B Why did you move to la? A Because I wanted to pursue my acting career. B That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? A Well, it wasn't a hard decision. It was just. It was the weather, it was the opportunity, it was the options. More options. B How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? A The driving has been a pain in the butt. Not so easy. B What are some things you really like about la? A Let's see. Besides the weather, I like that things are more convenient. I like some of the people here that are actually from home. But yeah, I just like that it's a little laid back. That's about it. B What are some things you don't really like about la? A I don't like the traffic. I don't like the gang violence in certain areas. And I don't like. What else don't I like? Huh? Maybe that's all I don't like. You know, I don't like that it's so far away from home. I wish. I wish LA was kind of Midwest. I wish it wasn't so far from home. B Tell me about your relationship with your family. A I have a close relationship with my family. It's a small. Immediate family is really small and we're close. My grandmother recently passed, so it's an adjustment. Right. Right now. But I'm close to my family. B Okay. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? A Well, I can't see your shoes, but I do travel often. I do travel, yes. B What do you enjoy about travel? A Getting there. I like Getting there. Once I'm at wherever I'm going, I like to actually do the tourist thing, get to know places and people. B I'd love to hear about one of your trips. A Okay. Oh, I went to France a few years ago, well, many years ago, and a little town called Carcassonne. And was very. It was actually really fun, but very much like a storybook as far as what I expected to see and what I actually saw. Like, what I remembered that I really enjoyed was that at night when everybody closes up, like, there are no windows in the buildings, but there are these shutters that most places in the United States have inside of windows. They have them outside of the windows, and there's no glass, so you just shut. And it looks like everything is abandoned. Like, the buildings are abandoned. So pretty cool. I like that. B Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A I'm borderline. Sometimes I'm shy, sometimes I'm outgoing. It depends on who and what the situation is. B Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? A Um, music. I turn on music. I walk through the neighborhoods, you know? B Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? A I'm pretty good at controlling my temper. I'm. I'm not a hothead at all. B That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? A Hmm? Oh, it was an ex roommate, and it was about my loyalty as a friend. B Can you tell me about that? A Yeah, pretty much. She thought that because I wanted my rent, which she agreed to pay, that I was not being a good friend, that I should just let her live for free, and that wasn't going to happen. So, you know, the loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her stay anyway, even after she didn't pay me. So that's a friend. I could have kicked her out. I didn't. She left at the agreed time after she let me know that she was not going to pay. But, you know, she could have. Could have been a bad situation, but there was an argument there. A real. A real one. B Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. A I wish I had handled that situation differently and followed my first mind when we agreed to be roommates temporarily and got my money up front. That's what I wish I had done. And I just. I didn't. My mind told me to go along with it. No, my mind told me to get the money up front, but I didn't. So. B Tell me about the hardest decision. Decision you've ever had to make. A The hardest decision? I think I have yet to make the hardest decision, but so far, like, maybe leaving home. Leaving home when I was. Years ago, when I was, like, 18, yeah. B How did you feel in that moment? A I felt like I was abandoning my family. That's what I felt. But they encouraged me to go on and live my life. B That's good. A Mm. B Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. A Ah, something that I could erase from my memory. Probably a friend who I was dating. I would like to erase from my memory how he responded to me when I told him my grandmother was ill. B How easy is it to. For you to get a good night's sleep? A It's easy if I'm busy all day and I'm really, really tired, but actually, my mind spins, so it's not that easy. Actually, it's not that easy. I'd have to, because I have to be exhausted. I have to be exhausted. That sounds really hard to be exhausted. No, it's not really hard. You just do a lot of stuff all day long. B What are you like when you don't sleep well? A Irritable. B Okay. How have you been feeling lately? A Up and down. I've been up and down. Like, sometimes I've been excited and anxious, and on the other outside, I'm like, what am I doing? B Are they triggered by something? A Yeah, just an anxiousness to want to make some things happen, some goals and. B Like, what? A Getting certain kind of work and having a certain amount of income and just taking care of myself, you know, the way I think I should take care of myself. Just the physical stuff, eating right and everything. B Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? A Yeah, I have. B Can you tell me about that? A Sometimes I have a lot of distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what I need to be focused on in the moment, and I'm conscious of that. I'm like, of all the things that just popping up in my head, why am I thinking about that? B How do you cope with them? A I let them happen. And then I try to think about other things and phase it out. It pops back up. I phase it out. Yeah. B Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? A No. B Have you been diagnosed with depression? A No. B Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. A Uh, when the roommate moved out. I was really happy when she finally left. B Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. A Probably reading. And maybe I'LL go dancing. That would be ideal. If I can go dancing. Go salsa dancing and. Yeah. B What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? A Mmm, my ability to make a decision quicker and to act on it. B Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. A Really badly. I don't know if I have a time that someone has ever made me feel really badly. I don't feel bad about much. B Okay. How would your best friend describe you? A Uh, as courageous. That would be it in a nutshell. B Okay. A Is there anything you regret in general? I regret not making some different decisions when I was younger. As far as moving forward, as far as career stuff and relationship things. I wish I had done some things earlier in my life that I'm doing now. B Can you give me an example of that? A Really going after some of my personal goals and deciding to actually be in a relationship. That's long term and yeah, I wish I had done that earlier. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A 20 years ago, I would have given myself the advice to continue with my schooling beyond what I did and to be more discerning in my choices of individuals who I allow in my life. B What are you most proud of in your life? A Being a part of the family that I'm a part of. B That's so good to hear. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. A Thank you. B Goodbye. A Goodbye. I didn't know if it went. B No, that's for sure. Okay. A Okay, recording.

"A Thanks. Okay, great. B All right. Wonderful. Okay, thanks. A Hi. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yeah. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm okay. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B I'm from Los Angeles. A Really? B Mm. A What are some things you really like about la? B Oh, the weather. The weather, the weather, the weather. The beach. The weather, the beach. The laid backness, the driving instead of public transportation, and the sporty. I really. I don't know. The lack of. I don't know. There's not a lot I don't like about la as compared to most cities. I really. It's my favorite. And I've lived around the world. I love it. I love LA a lot. A That's great. I'm sure you can tell by these shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. B Yes. I've lived in Paris and I've been around the world a lot. A Awesome. What do you enjoy about traveling? B It's just. It's fun and it's a blast. It's good to see new places. It's good to get to experience all the fantastic sights and. And cultures. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B Well, I mean, I tended to actually do a lot of them. I probably would do them differently. I think I'm more developed as a person now. I lived in Paris for two years and I lived in Spain. Spain was fun. Madrid is a party town. And then. And then. So these were all work. They were all work. So I was working. So it was a grind. And you didn't really appreciate, you know, what was around you so much. And then, I mean, I still. I love going just to, you know, vacation spots like Hawaii and Jamaica. I'm still just really a sucker for that kind of stuff. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B I guess Madagascar was pretty much, like, just really bitching because it was in the 80s and it was like you were seeing a lot of people that had never seen white people before, according to the guy driving us around. He might have been lying, but it was just. It was bitching. Africa was pretty much the best. Senegal and Madagascar. Yeah. A Nice. What did you study at school? B I'm right now about to go for an early childhood education degree. And then I did a little bit of a paralegal, but that was really just to. Just to get the stipend. I didn't really have any concept of what I wanted to do, and now I really do. A What made you decide to do that? B I have. I was saying to Rachel, actually, I don't know if you guys were able to over here. I really think that the way the school system goes right now, it turns people into just dog eat dog. I don't like the way. I think it's soul draining the school system right now. And I feel pretty bad for everybody. So I want to try to fix that. A What's your dream job? B That would be my dream job. So I'm excited that, like, I want to go in a direction that I want to go in. Yeah, that would be. My dream job, is to work with sort of getting kids on a more organic, universal, you know, trajectory. A How hard is that? B I think it could be done. I don't think it would be done via any sort of legislation except here and there. I mean, that always ends up becoming, you know, facade and farce itself anyway. But I think there are ways. I've always reached kids anyway, and they've always felt where I was coming from. And so I think, you know, there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system. A Okay. Do you consider yourself worse shy or outgoing? B I guess I'm just a combination of the two. I don't think. I don't know. Actually. I'm kind of. I might even be working that out. There might be some outgoingness to overcompensate for what's actually shyness and vice versa. So you don't know? Yeah, yeah. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. B Yeah, that's cool. A What do you do to relax? B I definitely try to reflect and stay in a pretty lucid space as often as possible. So a lot of lying down at the moment. I'm in transition, so there's just a lot of. And I hang out with my dogs a lot, so that's quite soothing. I try not to do. I don't really do anything that's too tense unless it's time for it, like time to drive to a job or time to, you know, go make some things happen, meetings and stuff. But otherwise I try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time. So it's not like break And. But, you know, and I miss swimming. I can't believe summer's coming, so I'm going to swim some more, too. A How are you at controlling your temper? B When I'm truly outraged, it comes out. And then I'm hitting some kind of bad parts right now because it's a very hard time. I'm fighting for my child. So there are times when I will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam. A Has that gotten you in trouble? B A little bit, but usually pretty much. There's always, you know, someone in the periphery that gets it and, you know, it's like that bumper sticker. If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention. So usually some kind of sanity can prevail. A When was the last time you argued with someone? B Oh, well, I mean, these are also times where I just can't find something in the car. But when I argue with people, it's been a lot of the times when I'm being flat out, you know, sabotaged or definitely just when. What's the last specific time? Well, I, you know, I lost my temper dreadfully with, unfortunately, the woman that gave me birth because that. She is intrinsic in a lot of. I mean, she's pretty much horrible person. So I recently lost my temper with her. A How did you feel in that moment? B I felt like. I mean, I. Like, again, I think I sort of said this just now. I felt, in a way, good, because I get it, you know, which is. As opposed to not getting it, which is even worse. But I guess there's another side of the bank of the thing to get to, to where you can be a little more constructive about it. It's like, you know, you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a horrible travesty going on, but then you have to figure out how to deal with the horrible travesty. But. So, I mean, I didn't feel like, shame. I really honestly didn't feel shame. I didn't. I didn't feel. There are times when I feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because there are people that will try to use that against you. That's all. But I never really feel bad for being angry about what I'm angry about. A Okay, tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Well, when I was pregnant, I wish I had. Like I said, I went through such an awakening about realizing when I was being sort of undermined, that demanding my respect became a huge issue. And when I was pregnant, I ended up being so disrespected in the place because I was being a hippie on the beach for six years. So I felt like I was being so disrespected in the place where I was set to be when the child arrived that I stormed out via what was a good survival mode before, but left me jumping out of the frying pan into the fire and they got my kid, so. A Wow. B Yeah, that sounds really hard. It's fucked up, I know. A Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B I don't want to erase anything from my memory. I like having everything consolidated and cohesive and integrated. I don't want to erase anything from my memory. A Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Well, did I get it right or did I get it wrong? Yeah, I guess the hardest decision was whether or not to sign mediation agreement with dcfs. And I should have said, no, let's just go straight to court, because there is nothing wrong with me. I just happened to succumb to an SSI check via bullshit with my mother, and I should have just been, you know, brave enough to just go in there and do that. And instead I chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out. A What made you decide to do that? B Over cautiousness. A Okay. Tell me about your relationship. B It's horrific, horrendous, Borgia quality, intrigue and sabotage. It's bad. That's okay. Someone that, I mean, there's been, you know, there's been some. Some great people again from afar. I have not sort of really achieved a real great ability to build relationships. And I'm working through that right. Right now. And I think that's a lot. Why I don't have my son. But as I've grown and developed, I've seen encouragement from like minded souls. And you can see that. And so that's wonderful. But otherwise, you know, a constant, you know, contact with someone that's really good for me. It has been hard for me to get to that point. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Not so easy these days at all. Why I'm being, I've been. I'm not completely centered. And then there's been some actual, you know, people thinking it's funny to harass me or jolt me as they walk by. And so there's been actual harassment and stuff like that. A What are you like when you don't sleep? Well. B I'm still pretty Pollyanna ed out I still forge ahead and try to be as pleasant as possible. A How have you been feeling lately? B I'm tired and drained and a little bit frustrated because I know that I've been sort of. Did I sort of have a bit of my energy and space being usurped and I can tell. And I don't know how to get through that and past it. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B There are. I'm basically a very, very, very happy, pretty much blissed out person. But this fighting for my son has me sort of trudging areas that. It's as if the same trees that were thrown in my road in childhood before I realized I was such a happy person are thrown there again. So I'm going through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes. But, you know, during the day I'll. I'll think something completely true and organic and I'll just stare at something and go, wow, that's beautiful. And I'll be reminded that I'm pretty close to my spirit. So I try to stay there 24 7. I'm pretty spiritual that way. A How would your best friend describe you? B I mean, if I had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me. Gets pretty competitive out there that, you know, that I'm. This is off you guys. That I'm funny and that. And that I think that's bad. That I'm funny and that I'm good and that I'm trustworthy. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Just I. Not necessarily change, but grow through my ability to connect with the people I want to connect with and disconnect from the people that managed to drain me. I already said I regret the thing with leaving the place where I could have delivered my son, even though I was being sort of abused. A Right. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Get the fuck away from your mother. Sorry. You know, and like a lot of. And yeah. And to open your eyes. Look what. Look what's going on. A Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? B I'm proud of my spirit and my outlook and my. My access to what's really going on in the world and my awakeness. I'm just proud of me as a person. A That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. B Okay. A Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B You're welcome. A Bye. B Bye. Right on. This came off. Okay. It's the old thing? Yeah, it's the old test. It's the other one, like, sort of two questions ago.

"A Okay, great. Okay, press this button, come back in. B Okay. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yeah, that's perfectly fine. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm feeling great. It's an early morning. I don't have school. I'm excited. Born and raised in Los Angeles, California. A Really? What are some things you really like about la? B The fact that you can surf, snowboard, and, like, do two drastically different things in one day. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B Coming from the neighborhoods I've lived in, I'd say the population of lower socioeconomic backgrounds, it's like a cesspool almost for young African Americans. And it sucks. A Yeah, I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B Not really. I've been to New York, Connecticut, Mexico and Texas, but pretty young. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Mostly, if I'm traveling by plane, just the sight in the air. It's amazing. It's remarkable. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B The first time I went to New York, I was about 11 years old and I made sure I got the window seat on the plane and just the feeling of taking off is just exhilarating. But we left at night here in la and it was the next day in New York. So it was kind of confusing getting used to the time change. And the first thing I remember doing was getting a slice of New York pizza, and it was delicious. A Nice. B Yep. A What do you study at school? B Graduating with the bachelor's degree in communications so I can go into the military as an officer. A What made you decide to do that? B Actually, it's like, what? I don't know. It's like you gotta have a plan and it's the only thing that's just fallen into place. And it seems like it's going to fall into place for me. A What's your dream job? B To be honest, a job that doesn't exist. It's however you can get paid to do. Nothing. Yeah, but probably. I was definitely shy as a kid, but I've grown into myself through the experience of college. I'm way more outspoken that's great. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I write music and I work out mostly. So if I'm feeling stressed out, I just do a set of push ups and lift some weights. A How are you at controlling your temper? B I'm pretty good. I saw a therapist when I was a kid for about a year and I don't know, it taught me to just be able to control my emotions. And I don't think I do it in the best way because when I'm angry, I do decide to just bottle my emotions in instead of letting them out in their appropriate outlet. A Has that gotten you in trouble? B Not really. It's been more of an interpersonal thing that I don't know. A Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? B Probably yesterday. Something in regards to sports. The playoffs are on, so things like that. Of that nature. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Um, so many, I guess. In my senior year of high school, I waited till the last minute to apply for the UC schools and it was unsuccessful because I didn't get to turn in the applications. And I'm pretty sure I would have been admitted. So it sucks. But hey, tell me about the hardest. A Decision you've ever had to make. B That is an intriguing question. I've actually no clue. A Okay, tell me about neven or something. Something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B The death of my grandmother. A Can you tell me about that? B Sure. My grandmother died when I was 11 years old. She raised me from the time I was born because my mother was unable to take care of me. She raised my sister, my brother and my cousin as well and her five children. So she was the matriarch of our family and the closest thing I've had to a mother. It was tough, but it's going to be seven years this May on the 30th, and I've grown quite a bit. No more tears. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B I'm a foster kid, so I was emancipated from the foster program about two years ago now. But my immediate family, I'm pretty close with them and I see them as much as I can. And my foster family, they're awesome. I've known them since I was five, so it's been pretty cool. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Fairly easy. I fall asleep pretty quick. It's not a problem except for when my back's hurting. Then it's a problem. A little moody in the morning. I guess I drive more aggressively. A little stressed about a few problems that I can take care of, but I shouldn't stress because I either can do something about it or I can't. That's just the way things work. A Can you tell me about that? B Sure. I have a few parking tickets. Not parking tickets. They're not moving violations, but they're tickets. And I was unaware of if you miss court without being in the hospital or being in jail that you couldn't be excused from not making your court date. So I had three failure to appear in court, which suck. Tickets that are thousands of dollars, and I have no money. So I don't know. It's pretty tough to deal with when you're trying to make something out of your life. But there's so many barriers and obstacles that, like, you didn't foresee. So, I don't know. It gets stressful at times and. Yeah. How do you cope with them thinking about it for periods of time? Some days I just sit and I'm just lost in my thoughts. And I don't really communicate to anyone because there's nothing anybody can do for me, really. So I just bottle it up like I do everything. A How hard is that? B Not very. After doing it for so long, it becomes a natural thing, I believe. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Hmm. Really happy. Why is that such a difficult question? I don't know. I'm pretty content with everything right now. I don't know about extreme happiness. Every day is just the same day. Seems like. A Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Dunking across the street at the Clipper Center. There's a basketball court there, and I've been working on it for a while, and I finally got up. A Nice. B Yeah. A How do your best friends describe you? B I have four close friends that I've known for over eight years each, and. I don't know. Studious, hard working, determined. I don't know. Yeah. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Probably my metabolism, which I don't really have control over, so I don't know. I'm pretty content with myself. A When someone made you feel really badly about yourself? B Hmm. I think in my sixth grade, year of grade school, I wasn't the best of students, but I had a teacher who was diligent and, like, he failed me through the whole year. But I learned a lot and I developed a passion for school afterwards. So it was like a situation I overcome after feeling so bad and down. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B The same teacher who made me feel really bad, actually, because if it wasn't for his, like, sternness, I don't think I would have gained the discipline to be where I am now in college and stuff. So he'd have been pretty influential. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B I remember this time I was in the desert or up in Joshua Tree with my best friend and his dad, and we actually got stuck in the mountains and, like, we went down a gully and his jeep wouldn't get over a rock. So it was. It was pretty. Yeah, it was. It was kind of weird. I thought I was Superman. I tried to move a rock. I was thousands of pounds. Didn't work. But, yeah, we eventually got out. We thought we were going to be stuck in the desert, but it was a fun time. I got to drive in the desert when I didn't have my license, so it was fun. Yeah. A That sounds like a great situation. B Is there anything you regret about that day or in general? A Whatever comes to your mind. B Other than, like, the UC thing, like, where I didn't apply to the schools in time. I regret that. Yeah. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Hmm. I don't know. I was 10 years old 10 years ago. I'd probably say to myself, I have no clue. That's an interesting question.

"A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Internet. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm okay. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B Pennsylvania. Well, I was in Boston for a couple years and then I moved here about three and a half years ago. But I just wasn't satisfied with the quality of my life. Maybe once or twice last year, I only got to go back once a year. Definitely safer and definitely a more. Well, I dismiss it because I have a lot of family back there. But LA is okay. I mean, everyone loves the climate here. A How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B Not too easy. I have two really good friends here and I have a boyfriend I've been with for three years, so that helps. He's from here, but it definitely took a bit of adjustment. A Okay. Do you travel a lot? B No. A What do you study at school? B Advertising? Communications? No, I'm currently working in. Actually, I'm not working right now at the moment. I want to be a naturopathic physician. A Tell me more about that. B So basically versus Western medicine, a naturopathic physician is someone who helps someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms, but treats them as a whole person. So they look at nutrition, they look at diet, exercise, just a variety of things to actually get someone to live a healthier life versus medications or things that are commonly prescribed now in the Western medicine. A How did you decide to do that? B Well, one of the great things was when I came out here to la, I was exposed to the degree which I had never heard of. Living on the east coast sometimes. Well, I'm very particular about the people I like to surround myself with and I don't like to socialize with a lot of people. I mean, I tend to like small, intimate groups and I don't tend to like to be in larger or bigger groups when people don't take into account other people's feelings. A What do you do when you're annoyed? B I usually try to go for a walk if I get very irritated. A How are you at controlling your temper? B I'm usually really good. It really takes a lot for me to spill over and to yell or become upset. A That's good. When was the last Time you argued with someone? B Let's see. I was with my lawyer, and it was about his handling of my case. Yeah, it was. He's. They're. I don't know. I think they're just a little bit mediocre. They're not the best lawyers. A How would your best friend describe you? B I have no idea. I'm very trustworthy. I'm loyal. I care very deeply. So I like to try to help other people. And I always like to try to cheer people up. I think that's. That would be some of them. A Have you ever served in the military? B No. Yes. Just a few months ago. About the last six months. I was experiencing mental issues that I never really came across before. Paranoia and anxiety. And I knew that it wasn't. I knew that it wasn't. That I couldn't overcome it by myself. A How have you been feeling lately? B A lot better. I've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation. Kind of seeing things from a different purview, or not purview, but a different view. And that's helped. But there's definitely times where I kind of sink back into thinking about the event, especially because the event caused me to stop working. A Are they triggered by something? B I think I have a difficulty being in public. I'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen. So. So a lot of times during the day is when it happens. So I'm not that comfortable going out during the day. I tend to go out in the mornings and evenings, and I don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out. Well, I've been gradually trying to increase how much I'm outside, and I usually just. Deep breathing. I do a lot of breathing exercises. And I just try to say that basically what I'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real and that I just. I try. I just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually. A lot better since the last couple months, but before, I very much pretty much stayed home. A How has seeing a therapist affected you? B It's been good. It's been good to hear someone's feedback, but I feel like I've gotten more help with just my inner talk with just kind of sitting with myself and journaling. A Do you still go to therapy now? B I do. A Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B Well, I feel more like myself, which is a huge improvement. And I am more cautious and regarded in some ways about my thoughts and about my Decisions as well. I'm not so. I'm not so. Oh, you know, I'll just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that I want in my life. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B It's gotten better. I'm better now. The first three months, it was very difficult. I couldn't sleep through the night, and I woke up maybe two or three times and would be awake for a couple hours. But now I am sleeping through the night again. I'm groggy, feel foggy and out of it and just low, kind of depressed. A When was the last time you felt really happy? B I think it's been a while. Working. I'm a bit of a workaholic. Spending time with my family. Yeah, Just being outside, enjoying nature, reading. A How close are you to your family? B Very close. What is that? Well, my parents, because they've always been very supporting and loving, giving me feedback about my decisions or what I'm choosing to do, but allowing me to make my own decisions, my own choice, choices in life. And then my sisters have just always been very, you know, just always checking with me. I'm the baby. I'm the youngest in the family, so they always looking out for me and just checking in with me. And then my boyfriend, Shootsma, with this incident that happened, he's been very usually supportive with just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when I'm feeling and not wanting to go out in public and being aware of that, that it's not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop or run an errand without having a lot of anxiety. I'm most proud of the jobs, the work that I've done, the people I've helped. Maybe that I took this job where I was assaulted at. That would be it. Going into retail, into this unsafe environment, not listening to my gut. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B What advice would I what? A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. B To recklessly pursue your dreams that there is no such thing as too late or running out of time. And to enjoy every moment of your life, not take anything for granted. A Something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Let's see. Well, cooking, I really enjoy. I really enjoy cooking. So I made some roasted vegetables. Just anytime I'm cooking, I just really enjoy it. We have a garden, so we had collard greens that came up and some chilies and cauliflower. So just using. Preparing that for my boyfriend and I. A Awesome. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. B Bye.

"A And actually, I'm going to have you scoot back just a little bit, actually. Sorry. Just. If you want to stand up, I'll put the chair. B Okay. A Okay. Now you can have a seat. Thank you. All right, so now I'm going to put the doorbell over here. When she's done, she'll let you know. You can press that button. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing really good. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B I'm from Granada Hills, California. It's the San Fernando Valley part of Los Angeles. A What are some things you really like about la? B I love the weather. I like the diversity in people. I like how you can go to a neighborhood and it's not just one race or kind of food. I love the beaches, all the activities you could go do theme parks, aquariums, stuff like that. Museums. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B The smog. There's a lot of creepy guys. A I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B I pretty much traveled around LA. I've been cross country and back three times. Twice was when I was 17. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B I like meeting new people and trying different foods and seeing how other people live. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B When I was 17, I ran away with my boyfriend to upstate New York to Watertown. It was like a Navy army kind of town. We had an apartment there. It snowed a lot. We sold antiques for a living. A Awesome. What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Getting passes, press passes for the Sunset Strip Music Festival through a friend. And getting to meet rock stars and hang out at, like, the private parties. A That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I'm very outgoing. I love people. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's. That's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I go to the gym and work out quite a bit. I find it Helps relieve stress and keeps my energy level going. I notice if I don't work out a couple days, I feel a little more tired than normal and it just helps me feel good. A How are you at controlling your temper? B I'm pretty good at it. I'm very calm. I worked a lot of events and jobs where you're dealing with, like, thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to and you have to remain calm and, you know, they're the customer, so you have to make them feel wanted and good and realize that you're getting paid because the money they're spending. So I'm good at resolving, like, consumer conflicts and stuff on the job. A When was the last time you argued with someone? B I had a drunk friend that was just falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people. And I kind of started getting loud, like, just telling her to stop doing that and that she was embarrassing and what she was saying to people was very mean, you know, And I wonder, like, if you're talking to people like that, they might not like it and they could attack you or something, you know, you never know. It is la. A Yeah, that sucks. What's something you feel guilty about? B I really don't feel guilty about anything. Decisions I've made in my life. I think I've made really good decisions, and I always stick with my moral compass, what I'm doing. I grew up in church, so I haven't gone in years, but I still have those values and, you know, the rules, the Ten Commandments and stuff in my head. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B I had a slumlord landlord, and I wish that I called, you know, the proper authorities and followed through on a court case instead of letting him, like, kind of bully me out because it wasn't up to code. Tell me about the hardest decision you've. A Ever had to make. B A few years back, I was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back to where he was from. And after a few months, you know, he was coming to LA and going back home. I decided to move there. And I had just started, you know, this business I was doing, event planning was picking up, and I decided to leave there and try to do it there on the east coast. And it didn't work out. But it was tough deciding, should I leave LA and make this jump and try something new and experience something new or stay in what I was doing. A What did you study at school? B I had a degree in dental assisting. I did that for a year. I didn't like it. And then I was studying communications, like radio and television broadcasting and journalism. A Are you still working in that? B Somewhat. I'm doing event work and I wrote for a magazine a couple years and I'm trying to like get a website going and then have like where I'm controlling my own writing and what's going on instead of, you know, writing for someone else. I always wanted to ride and was always into the news and music and art. Growing up I really liked Connie Chung. She was like a Channel 4 newscaster in the 80s. And I loved Barbara Walters. A That's great. B I was a nerd. No. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B My sister, she doesn't talk to any of the family. And I have a good relationship with my mom. I never really knew my dad. It doesn't bother me. I have cousins and stuff, but everyone's scattered across the country so I don't really talk to them on phone. We just communicate on Facebook or like Twitter. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Oh, I go right to sleep. When I get tired, I just go to sleep. A How have you been feeling lately? B Pretty good. Energetic. I've been motivated to go look for more event work, you know, event planning stuff and really grinding it more than I was. A How hard is that? B I mean it's kind of hard because you gotta talk to people and get them to trust you and see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B I mean, I'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer or someone I know dies. I wouldn't say that. I'm just super like, oh my God, happy all the time. But it's like an even keel that I feel pretty good all the time. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm very talkative and friendly and I could approach strangers and talk to them at ease. And I could adapt to different situations. And even if it's not my scene or a situation or a group of people that I'm used to, I could still jump in, talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adapt. A Uh huh. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B I want to make more money. A Me too. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. B I remember in like second grade this people used to make fun of me because I was very tall and skinny and I had like straight A's, one of the highest grades in the class. So people would make fun of me and call me giraffe or stuff like that. A How would your best friend describe you? B Very talkative. She would just say that I talk to everyone and I'm very friendly and if you need help, that I'll help someone you know. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Oh, recently I went up to Oceanside and visited a friend I've known years and we just went out for burgers and hung out on the beach and we got her two year old son and like took him to the park and played and it was really nice and it was cool visiting her. I hadn't seen her in six months and it was really fun and I want to go again and I like the area. A What's something you feel guilty about? B I guess maybe I could be trying to find my own work more like for my business instead of working for other people. I think I pursue it, but I think maybe I could put a little more time, a day into it. A I see what you mean. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B I don't really know anything like that we want to erase or not happen. A Okay. Is there anything you regret? B No. I feel good about my choices I've made and I think I'm on the right path. And a lot of things I wanted to do, the ball's rolling and I'm, you know, getting things done. I'm not as big as I want to be, but I feel like I'm on my way there. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Like 10 years ago I would have told myself to work more in the daytime instead of going out as much as I was. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B My friend we call Mojo. A Can you tell me about that? B Mojo has a magazine and I just wrote years and he really pushes me to like keep writing and keep doing events and keep on the ball. I'm rolling. And he's one of the biggest people, you know, in my life. Telling me you're talented, you could do it. You know, he's just a really good, like motivation for me. A That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? B You know, being published. I've been on TV shows and just getting my own event thing going and I have a lot of people who read what I write every day and follow. And I just think it's a. You know, it's not exactly hunter where I want to be, but it's a great start. And I worked to get to that point. A Yeah. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Great. Thanks. A Goodbye. Hi. Goodies. You can take the headset off and I'll stop the recording. Thank you.

"A She's. She'll ask you some stuff, but, yeah, she. She can understand how to respond to some questions. So when she's done, she'll let you know. I'm going to put the doorbell over here and hopefully it'll work, but I'll try to. Sometimes our system can let us know too. B Okay. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Pretty good. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B I grew up in Boston. A Really? When did you move to a. B About 30 years ago. A That's a long time. B Yep. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B Not too often. Maybe once a year, sometimes less. A How does it compare to la? B Oh, I love living in la. I don't ever want to live anywhere else. A Why did you move to la? B Well, I came out here to go to college and I wanted to be far away from my parents. And the weather was good, and that's part of it. A Okay. How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B Very easy. Well, maybe somewhat easy. The beginning. The first few weeks was really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody I knew. But after a few weeks, it was great. A What did you study at school? B Broadcast journalism. A That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? B Well, it's something I'd wanted to do since I was 12, and everything I did from the time I was 12 until I went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream. A Are you still working in that? B Nope. Well, it's kind of a long story, but I got laid off from my first job when I was in my 20s, and it just. Once I had done that work, I realized that's not really what I wanted to do. It was too cutthroat of a business, and it just really wasn't suited for me. It didn't make me happy. A It can be tough to find a good job these days. B You? Yep. A What's your dream job? B My dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries. A Nice. How hard is that? B Well, the work itself is not very hard. I'm very good at what I do. The hard part is finding the Right People and making the connections to work with them. A I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B I used to. I don't travel so much right now. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B I love seeing different places and different things. Like, I love going to places that are not like, where I'm from. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B My favorite trip is I went to Australia for my 30th birthday because I wanted to lose my 30th birthday as I crossed the international date line. And I went to this really small place up on the west coast of Australia called Sharks Bay, where native dolphins live and swim and is very isolated from the most part. And I got to be there for a whole weekend just really. Just pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins. And they come and they swim with you and it's amazing. Just a beautiful, beautiful spot in the world. A Awesome. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B More shy. A Why? B Why? That's a good question. Partly the first thing I think of is because I've always been that way. But maybe that's an excuse. I don't know. I just prefer to be quiet and I'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people, so. A Okay. Sometimes when. When I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I watch TV a lot. That's probably not the best alternative, but it is something I do. And I also walk on the beach because I live close to the beach, so that's one of my favorite things to relax. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Pretty good. It depends on the situation, but most of the time I'm pretty good. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B I don't think I tend to argue with people. I think I just get mad about situations, but not at people directly. A Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? B Hmm. I don't know if I feel guilty about anything at the moment. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. B Not sure I have one at the moment. A Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? B Noise. Other people's noise makes me really mad. I live across the street from a bar, and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not considerate about their neighbors. That. That just makes me really mad. A That sucks. B Yeah. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make? B Well, the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is when I bought my condo. It felt like a really hard decision. At the time I didn't know that I could do it. I wasn't sure if I had the money to do it. So that felt like a really difficult decision. But in hindsight, of course, it turned out to be a great decision. But at the time it was really difficult to do that. A Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Pretty easy. I sleep pretty well. A That's good. How have you been feeling lately? B For the most part, good. I'm just really worried about money at the moment. So that's my biggest. So I can't say that I'm like, great because I am worried. But you know, I'm also confident that things are going to work out. A That's good. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Nope. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Nope. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Hmm, I don't know. I can't remember. I mean, I don't feel super happy all the time, but I don't feel unhappy either. Sort of like just a even keel. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Well, I get to go to the. My friends work at the Motion Picture Academy so I get to see all the Nausicle Oscar nominated movies. She was there one night so I really enjoyed catching up with her and seeing her again. So that was very pleasant. A Nice. How would your best friend describe you? B I think they would say reliable and loyal and considerate and thoughtful. A Is there anything you regret? B No, I really have worked hard on that. I think there are lots of things maybe I would do differently, but there's nothing that really I regret. A Regret? B Well, I just think that there are things that, like, it's not worth wasting the energy to think about things that I regret. So I don't have a lot of regrets about things. A Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B That's a good question. Don't worry about the small stuff and save more money. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Well, it's, you know, the normal things, like I'd lose more weight than I would. I think be a little more fearless. Maybe be a little more bold. A Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B I don't think I have any of those. A Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B Well, I am self employed so I work all the time. So my ideal weekend is having lots of clients. That's something I enjoy. So that would be ideal at this point, my weekends, if I were really busy. A What are you most proud of in your life? B That I've really been able to take care of myself and that, you know, I've done pretty much everything that I've said that I wanted to do. I've done that. And I don't. And I don't have regrets about things. There's nothing really that feels undone in my life. Sure, there's plenty of things I still want to do, but I feel like I've done what I said I was gonna do. A That's great. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B Yeah, that's not so great. Well, it's okay. Both my parents are deceased and I have a sister and a brother. I feel closer to my brother than my sister but they both live on the east coast and I live in la and then my sister has two girls so I feel very close to my nieces. Although we don't talk as much as we used to because they're teenagers so they have other things on their mind. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Probably my teacher. Person I learned my holistic bodywork from. I really like to model my work and my way of being after him. Like he's a good role model for me. The way he holds his work and the way he lives his life. A That's so good to hear. How close are you to them? B We're pretty close. We're not, you know, best of friends, but I do, I know that I can call him anytime I need him. A What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? B Put me in a good mood? Usually being with my friends or going out to dinner or just spending time with my friends. A Uh huh. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. B Okay. A Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Thanks. A Goodbye. B Bye. It worked again. That was where else you'll leave? A Okay, good. Like to hear that.

"A Okay, looks good. All right, so now I'm going to give you this or go watch this. Once you're all done, she'll let you know. B Thank you. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yeah. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm fine. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B Pacific Grove, California. A What are some things you really like about la? B The wholesale opportunities and all the stores and anything I could ever ask for. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B The traffic, the mood of the people and the unhealthy pace. A I see what you mean. What did you study at school? B Let's see. I did like culinary, and then I did really good in art and music in high school. A How did you decide to do that? B Through my own will and desire to want to get involved with the music. A Are you still working on that? B No. A What's your dream job? B Open up a health practice of some sort. A What made you decide to do that? B Changing things in my life that had an impact on myself and others for the benefit of health. A That's great. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B When I have the opportunity. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Buying things, seeing the culture, relaxing, not thinking about the city. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B Well, I used to go to Texas every year with my dad during the summer. And I always wanted to stay there and live there when I went on vacation. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B Most likely one of these trips to Texas where we would go and spend time in the desert and shoot guns and ride go karts and stuff like that. A That sounds like a great situation. B It was. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B Let's see. Well, my dad and I are not really talking that much and my mom passed away about two months ago. A I'm sorry to hear that. B Thanks. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Definitely more shy. I've always been that way. A Why? B Just the personality that I've grown into. But learning how to adjust to the sensitivity and grow out of it. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish Tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B Tea. And, you know, eating. I like to eat. I mean, that calms me down. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Not that good. When I get really upset, it's usually a problem and I have to work to calm myself down. And sometimes I just don't. You get on something and I don't stop. Stop. A Has that gotten you in trouble? B Sometimes. But I've learned to control it to that extent now. Yesterday I was arguing about what kind of water we should be drinking. Oh, well, a difference of opinion. And I felt as though my opinion was very valid, even though the other party's opinion was somewhat misinformed. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. B Definitely. Every day is a growing process. I wish I would have handled everything differently every day, which is what makes me grow. And I try to work toward how I would have wanted to handle things every day, little by little. A Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Um, can't think of anyone right now. A What's something you feel guilty about? B Um, I, I, I'd say not supporting my friends as much with their career choices. A Can you tell me about that? B I'd rather not get into it. A Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B The raw food educators on YouTube and raw vegan educators and the detox therapy experts have been really inspirational in the past two months. A Tell me more about that. B Well, they believe that the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables. And this is true with many studies like T. Colin Campbell, the China Study. These sources of information that are very good and I think deserve respect based on real research. A Uh huh. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Really easy. I've almost got it down to a science. A That's good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? B I'm tired. A How have you been feeling lately? B Been feeling better than I have in a long time. A Can you tell me about that? B Yeah. I think it's due to the transition in the diet and in no way having a placebo effect that it's actually, you know, loosening up toxins and things that have accumulated over my short lifetime of, you know, toxic choices with food and drugs or whatever it would be. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B Yes. I'm less tense and less irritable and I have more clarity and more control over my decisions and my wants versus what I need, that sort of thing. A That's great. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Nope. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yes, to some extent. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B Over five years ago. Lack of motivation. And basically my symptoms were paralleling that of depression. A What were your symptoms? B Loss of appetite, loss of motivation, not wanting to do anything, not wanting to be social at all. Having fear of social situations. And this is the main four or five. A Do you still go to therapy now? B No. A Why did you stop? B I believe I overcome a chapter in my life that was the doctor taking control of my health and experimenting with drugs. And I just sort of took another route, which was alternative, and I started juicing more and just trying to listen to maybe what I needed with the help of the Internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that. A Do you feel like therapy useful? B Yes. A Can you tell me about that? B I believe therapy is useful because without looking inward or having somebody to help you do that, it's very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that will just resonate in the subconscious until you, you know, it has an outburst. Basically, therapy will help in overall health, mental health, I believe, for everybody. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Last night I made a really great vegan dinner with, you know, meat tacos and cheese and guacamole. Had a couple of my friends over, and they really liked it a lot. I almost converted them. A That's great. B Yeah. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B I would say, you know, trying to listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants me to do. Like, my brain likes caffeine and sugar, whereas, you know, my body needs something other than that as an example. A How hard is that? B It's very, very hard. It's a daily process. A Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. B I was handling money for a business partner and they ended up short. And I was to blame. But it was actually my formulas of crunching the numbers that it made it short. But he was unaware of the change I made to the formula. So the blame was on me that I may have took money, and I automatically felt bad about that because of my uneasy, my uncertainty to the change of formula. A Yeah. Is there anything you regret? B No. No. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B 20 years ago I was 2 years old. 10 years ago I was 12 years old. I would tell myself to start eating raw fruits and vegetables every day. A Okay. How would your best friend describe you. B As calm and sad. Maybe smart, talented. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B I really enjoyed going to the wholesale food market in downtown Los Angeles. A Can you tell me about that? B Lots of food, great prices. You can eat and feed a whole family for a third of the price is going to a normal supermarket. So I really get a lot of enjoyment of teaching people how to maybe better themselves, especially food wise and what they're eating. A Awesome. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? B Eating and watching a really good TV show. A Okay. What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm insightful. I can. I can adjust to people's. I don't know. I guess I'll skip that question for now. A Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? B I'm most proud of. I'd say my overall situation with where I'm at right now. I could have never imagined that I'd be in such a fortunate situation. A That's so good. Good to hear. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.

"R Now, that's it. Very well, so when it is finished, I'm going. B just wait for a small alert because our button does not work. All right. Come back to get you. Very well, thank you. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I'm going to ask a few questions to get started, and don't hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B Yeah, go ahead. A good. So how are you today? B um, I'm fine. A it's good. Where do you come from? B I grew up in the Wisconsin and I lived a little in Colorado, then I lived abroad for a little while, then I moved to California. A wow. MM. When did you move to the? B I moved here at the end of June of last year. So I guess it was, what, eight months? Something like that. How often do you go back to your hometown? B to the maximum, probably twice a year. How does he compare himself to the? B well, my hometown represents 5,000 people and there are many cows, barns and farms, therefore the opposite of. Why did you move to the? B This is a good question. I have always wanted to live in California, but I lived on the central coast and I had just descended, once a month for various commercial and networks and personal development. So, yes, things were changing to Santa Cruz for me. The customer I had, who was really the main financial source, I had finished this relationship. So I was totally free to move and I thought, well, I guess I will try to see what is going on. So I gave him a gunshot and I am there. How easy for you? B No, not at all. It is a very, very big city. I lived in Dublin, Ireland, which is also a big city, but, you know, European cities are much more condensed and public transport is much easier. And. Yes, therefore to move here and familiarize yourself with the city was quite difficult. And. Well, then, yes, I see what you mean. R I am sure you can say by my shoes, I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B I like to travel. I love him. Yeah. I lived in Ireland and I have traveled. I was in Morocco and I was in Costa Rica. I spent time in Mexico. So what do you like on travel? I love meeting new people, living new cultures and, like, not only to see what is different, but see what is similar among people Wherever you go. To I would love to hear about one of your trips. B of course. Well, I guess I try to think what was my favorite. I mean, there were incredible things about Morocco and the Costa Rica both, but Morocco was incredible. It was like 12 days, and we went to three different places. We went up to the Atlas mountains, which are beautiful, and yes, it is a really, really cool culture, so it was fun. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B My trip to Ireland. In fact, I visited there, that's why I decided to move there. So my most memorable moment of this trip. I mean, there are probably dozens, but the first most memorable moment of this trip was to be on a bus and to leave Dublin and to go out in the countryside and to see how breathtaking. I mean, it's. Everyone sees photos of Ireland or, you know, you see it in films, and it's green and lush and beautiful, but when you get there and you have the images do not do justice to them. So it was incredible. A great. B yeah. What did you study at school? B I have a first cycle diploma in English and psychology and minor psychology, and I have a master's degree in women's studies. Do you still work in there? B No, I use my English and my psychology. I work in marketing communications, so I make sales. So, yes, psychology definitely comes into play. And my too. I assume that my first cycle diploma in English. But really, like, I took that and. And has created something about it because most people who get an English diploma teach, and I didn't want to teach. One yeah. Which made you decide to do this. B to. I guess I'm not clear about the question. Let's go back to this later. B ok. A like my work. You could almost say that it is practically made for me. What is your dream work? B WOW. You know, my dream work is to be a motivator lecturer and a coach and a coach and browse the world, to do this and an impact on people's lives and really contribute to people. A good. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B My relationship is pretty good, in fact. I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother, who had not done it. She was sporadic. I saw her growing in sporadic. I lived. My father raised me, then he married my mother-in-law, and they had two children together. So I grew up. And I consider them the family with whom I grew up. But I entered communication with my biological mother last May, and we were. We have, you know, eliminated th Ings and has been in communication since then. R it's good. How did you feel at that time? B Well, I don't know when you mean, but if you refer to communication with my biological mother, it is very liberating to drop the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future. And not only the future, but in the present moment with it. SO. Yeah. Do you consider yourself more shy or out? B I'm shy. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B to relax? I do a number of things. I like to make yoga, even if I don't have the money for that for the moment. I love dancing, I like to read. I love going to the ocean and spending time watching the waves and absorbing all these negative ions. It really recharges my battery. In fact, probably more than anything else, I like to be with friends. I love art and I try new restaurants. Yeah, all these things are both relaxing. I guess they relax in the sense that I feel linked to the people of my life and to the experiences of my life. SO. Yeah. Yeah. How are you going to control your temperament? B um, depends if I drive. Not very good, but otherwise I am quite good in this area. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B UM, the last time, I argued with someone who should probably be. Oh, no, it was with the Times on the delivery of the newspapers. Yeah, it was the last time. Can you tell me? B Yeah, the newspaper which was supposed to show up to the elderly woman I take care of, it did not arise and I did not know that it was not there until late, I do not know, afternoon, I think in the early afternoon. And then I called them and they said that they could not send a replacement because it was after 10:30 am, which was absurd when they made the mistake in the first place. So, I mean, for a service for which we pay, for each day. So, yes, I was really irritated. And then I discovered that the newspaper had been sent to a new address and which had not been communicated with me. So I was angry with La Times. I was angry with the people who had transmitted the newspaper and who did not tell me. Yeah, I was quite frustrated. One yeah. Tell me about a situation you want you to manage differently. B oh, wow. There are quite a few. Let me think about one. The other day, I had a phone call And I'm in a coaching program. And it was one of the program coaches. She explained to me that there was an additional call that was going to be. We have meetings every week, class meetings, then we also have coaching calls because we have a particular coach with which we work. And then she called to tell me that I was going to have another coach call with someone who is not my coach. And. But that was not explained to me as part of the program. So, at that time, it just seemed to me that, oh my God, I have all those people to whom I must be responsible and, you know, I must not only be responsible for them, but share private things that happen in my life with these people. And it was right, I don't know. So, yes, I was not, I was not angry. I was fair, I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed at that time and, you know, and I talked to her with her and we crossed her. But yes, I could certainly have agreed with everything that asked me at that time and would have made the call much more fluid. At uh huh. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to make. B The most difficult decision. Wow. There were a few. I assume that moving to Ireland was probably the most difficult decision. No, it was not even the most difficult decision. It was such an easy decision, actually. But talking to my family was difficult. But the most difficult decision was the first time I moved away from my family. I was 28 years old and I decided to do so. I chose to move to Colorado and it was a fairly difficult decision because at that time, my family had been, you know, less than an hour on the road where I lived, an hour and a half. And now they are going to be, you know, at 12 o'clock in the road or a turn by plane. It was therefore difficult. What decided you to do this? B oh, a lot. I loved Colorado. Colorado is a beautiful beautiful condition and time is so much better than Wisconsin. And at the time, I was very in climbing and there was only a huge outdoor community in Colorado. So there were many more people who were in my age group and who were single. It was another factor and I was interested in the things that interested me. Colorado therefore seemed to be a really natural adjustment. So yes. And then I found a job that I liked. The salary was excruciating, but I found a job that was really enriching. And so everything got together and I chose to move. R that looks like an excellent situation. B yeah. A as it is easy for you t o Have a good night's sleep. B It was a completely independent question. Relatively easily, it depends on both that I am going to sleep. If I went out and I don't go home before 11:30 am, then you know, then I go to bed late and I wake up, feeling tired as I feel today. But generally, I can sleep all night. I have had fairly anxious dreams in the past two weeks, but even, even when I wake up from them or if I know, stirring, I can always go back to sleep relatively easily. Are they triggered by something? B Yeah, I'm sure they are. I mean, I am in another transition state. I leave. Outside the house in which I live right now or take care of an elderly woman. Yeah. And I'm just, I have to find the financial means to support me by doing this. And that's. And she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being. She is exhausting and totally depressing. SO. Yeah. How difficult? B Living with it is quite difficult. As if it was probably the most difficult thing I have ever done and that I would never choose to start again if I knew honestly, if I knew in which I was going to enter, I don't think I would have said yes to the situation. A I see. How do you feel recently? B I feel trapped and helpless, as if there is, you know, nothing I can. There is no way to get out of the situation in which I am. No matter what I do, it doesn't improve. I don't know, you know, I don't get any kind of work I want to do and my money does not work at all. So, yes, it's quite crazy. A I am sorry. B Thank you. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B I have in the past, yes. How long have you been diagnosed? B oh, long. I was 15, I think, or 14 years old. Over 20 years ago. What made you ask for help? B I was suicidal. Do you feel depressed? Well yeah, I feel depressed. Are you going to always in therapy now? B I don't do it, no. Why did you stop? B well, I stopped originally. Stop with my therapist because we had finished. I mean, we had worked on what had to be worked and I was no longer depressed. And then I started therapy again later. I think it was at the beginning of the thirties. And then we put an end to that because I had moved to Ireland. SO. Do you have the impression that therapy is useful? B Yeah, I mean, according to the therapist and according to your intention. As I do not go in therapeutic reflection, oh, I will be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years. I think it's ridiculous. I think you enter therapy to work on a specific problem and Have a solution and ask someone to be your resonance box that can see things you can't see and you know, through this situation and to find a strategy. Not only that, not only the creation of a solution in this area, but also the creation of strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you do not have to be in therapy forever. One yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B The last time I felt really happy. Well, huh. Wow is quite sad. It was at least a year ago. No, this is not true. It was when I saw my biological mother, who was last May. Do you know that you are some of your best qualities? B My best qualities? I am very strong. Very strong will. I am very favorable, loving and nourishing. I'm easy to be there. I am intelligent and. Yeah. Is there something you regret? B What I regret? I don't think, no. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B do not take life too seriously. To tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B oh, my ideal weekend. I spend time at the beach. I spend a little time with friends, either go out at night in a film, or just go out in a club or a bar or a place where we can simply sit and chat and be together. Maybe going to dance afterwards. And on Sundays to which I usually go. And then I have a brunch with friends and yes, I come home and on Sunday evening, I prepare for the next day. SO. A good. What are you most proud of in your life? B HMM. I am very proud of a few things. I mean, I moved to places where I wanted to move and so I did things that really talked to me and that meant something, you know, I was dear to my heart to actually. These objectives or these. Yeah, I did things I wanted to do, like moved to Ireland and moved to California. A it's great. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. B ok. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.

"R so when she has finished, she will say goodbye. And you will press this button and I will come back. B agree, great. A thank you. B Thank you. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I'm going to ask a few questions to start, and don't hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B I'm going pretty well. A it's good. Where do you come from? B I was born in Brooklyn, New York. I came here when I was seven years old and I’ve been here since. I consider myself nothing but Californian. What are you studying at school? B I am a welder. How did you decided to do this? B I come. I don't know. It was something to do and build things and repair things that intrigued me, and I was actually quite good in this area, so I stayed with it. And it's my profession. A it's great. What is your dream work? B gee, I really never had that. I just always hoped that I would have a job that could support myself and my family, and I was satisfied. R I understand. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B well, I recently lost my uncle, and he raised me since the age of 7. And apart from my wife, I have no more family. He died last July and I started to get back to it. I knew that the day would come, but he was my last living parent, so I was depressed on this subject. But I'm better. Do you consider yourself more shy or out? B It depends on the atmosphere. If I am with people with whom I don't feel comfortable, I am a little reserved. But if I am comfortable and I feel like I integrate myself, I am out. A tense feeling. I light the screen saving of the fisheal fish. I know it's not polite, but it's the best I have. Bright. What are you doing to relax? B I appreciate the old films. Old? Well, it's called Film Noir, and I love these old black and white films. And I go up on Netflix or Amazon and I try to choose a film at the time, people were different and them. I don't know, it's just another era and I like that. A great. How are you going to control your temperament? B well, my wife says I probably don't think so. But I have to admit that sometimes I lose my temperature. And that is, according to her, it is things on which I should not lose my composure. Booty I work on it. And I have essentially had this problem since I was a young child. Oh, yes, I was in trouble with the law when I was much younger. I have exceeded this point now. But, you know, when you are young, you think you know everything and you know that you will never age and that the future does not matter. But this is important because everything you do when you are young follows you for the rest of your life. And I don't regret the things I have done. But if I could go back, I would certainly make different choices. Oh, me and my wife, us. We do not discuss, we do not agree, and this is the case. She is very strong and she is a match for me. So we go and come, but, you know, we are not violent and we do not say nasty things or do not be injured. We are fair. She is a determined and strong determined woman and I am who I am. So we are going to somehow. And in recent times, I have been the one who entered myself and that it was the only one to lower the threshold of the argument because in the long term, it just injured me and there is no one more important to me. To tell me about a situation you want you to manage differently. B When I was younger, I want me to follow some of the people I followed. And what I mean by that is, you know, run in a circle with some people and have a bigger ego than my common sense. And that's what caused me trouble. I was a only child and I somehow appreciated being the center of attention and making girls laugh or making people think, you know, cool or other. You wouldn't think that now I'm a little overweight and bald. But when I had their twenties, I was a completely different person. And if I had brothers and sisters, I might not have thought or acted in this way. But I was a only child. So me, you know, I ran where people thought I was cool and it caused me in trouble. To Tell Me on the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. B The most difficult decision I have ever taken was to give the authorization to have my uncle die. He was on support for life and his kidneys had failed and the doctor said there was nothing more than he could do. And so as not to make him pass suffering to let him escape. And as you can see, I get angry very. My uncle raised me like his own son and never dropped me. And he left. And for lack of a better word, to press the button. I never thought I should do that. But as I said, I get back. And things improve slowly. My wife, she is always is there for me. She will always surprise me. She's not my wife. It's my best friend. And she knows me better than myself. We like to do simple things. It is not that we cannot do other things if we wanted it, but we chew. We appreciate the company of the other. We love the same things, and we know, come out sometimes and do something together, but we. We just appreciate the company's company. And she, as I say, knows me better than anyone, and it sometimes surprises me. A it's so good to hear. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B You know, lately. Well, I can't say lately if I don't. Excuse me. If I don't do a rigorous activity or something that really stole me or care for my body. Let's say for a few days, I'm just very relaxed and, you know, don't do much. I get up automatically after half past four, five hours. I mean. And, you know, my wife will say, you know, God, you don't sleep. But, I mean, I don't feel tired. I don't feel exhausted. I don't feel like I need to put myself to sleep. I'm going to stand all day up and I'm fine. And most people will say that it is not enough sleep. But, you know, for me, I am. It doesn't affect me. How have you been feeling lately? B well, I want certain things to be different, but I am not dissatisfied. I'm happy with my life as with someone else. There are a few things that I want to be different, and I think it's in everyone, you know, life, but I'm happy. Have you noticed changes in your behavior or. B Yeah, I feel a little less motivated. Recently? Well, I can't say recently. It was in January. My wife and a few friends noticed that I became forgetful and that I did not remember things. I haven't seen it. And, you know, when they. When everyone brought it to my attention, then I started. Anyway, I went to the doctor and they gave me the tests, and apparently I have MCI, which is a slight cognitive impairment. And I have in last month. No one mentioned me. I mean, maybe I improve myself, but the neurologist I saw brings me back in a year and will come back to me. I hope these are not the beginning stages of Alzheimer's. I'm still a little young for that. I am only 52 years old, but I was diagnosed with a slight cognitive impairment and it could have been due too, I was told, because of the death of my uncle, I could have been very depressed and I could not keep things. And so I return in a year and we will see if I am a Ny better. How do you face them? B I'm sorry? How do you face them? B I don't understand you. I'm sorry. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. No, I didn't do it. Yes, 2001. I was in one. What is the word I'm looking for? I was in one. In a state of mind of the place where I was just going to put myself in difficulty and. And do not take advantage of anything if I was not looking for. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder. Worry and think too much about things and think the worst. And I take medication for that. Well, you know, it's not really therapy. It's, you know, every few months, you know, you have to see the doctor, you are doing well, all good. And, you know, they simply fill your prescription. It is, you know, it is, you know, a bit like the next person. Next person. It is. I'm with Kaiser, so it's the case. It is. They will tell you, but that. They give you the impression that you know, okay, let's evolve. You know, they will hear your explanation, but, you know, they don't have all the time for you that you may want. So I'm fine, however. If I really needed help, I would. Would do something. The drug works for me. A good. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B the last time, I felt really happy. Well, it would depend on the event. I am always happy when I do something with me and my wife and we appreciate each other. And, you know, I don't try to seem to seem to be my whole world and I have nothing else. She is my world, but I like to be with her and we do things together. And I am happy all the time when we do that, when I am outside this circle. I do not know if it sounds well, but I do not seek happiness, I can only explain it because I am happy, I am not disappointed or I want nothing. I am, you know, all that comes to me is good. SO. How does your best friend describe you? B Well, I don't know. I. I couldn't give you this answer. Well, my best friend is my wife, but she would describe me as. I don't think so before I speak. I let things the smallest insignificant bother me and I get angry. But great things are as if I let go. And she is perplexed by that. Years and years ago, she had a classic Pontiac Lemans and had arrived at a bent of a minor mudguard and she thought it would be the end of the world because it was my baby and me, you know, hey, don't worry, we're going to repair it. And she, she thought I was going to hang her or something like that, you know, because it was My, it was, you know, it was my baby. And she's going, you know you are excited by nothing, but, you know, me. It is therefore the only way to explain it. What are the things you want to change about you? B well, I need to lose weight. As you can see, I am definitely on a food frenzy and the neurologist said it was probably due to the event with my uncle. It is the heaviest I have ever been in my life and I find it a little more difficult. I cannot say stronger, but I find the will to say no and stay with her and go exercise or you know, not, you know, the movement now maybe for walking. You know, me and my wife, when we were a little younger, we liked to make walks and we lived in one. Hey, my boy, you know, look at that. I wonder what's inside. You know, we don't do that anymore. I guess we are a little older now and a little heavier. It is more difficult to walk with all this weight. But I would like to be able to change this because, you know, it's not a healthy size. Is there something you regret. B lately? No, I haven't regretted anything lately. Everything is fine. As I say, the biggest and greater impact of my life was the event with my uncle. And I never had a hundred years or I never thought that I would face this situation. And I will never forget it. But they say that time heals all injuries, and this is the case. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B no longer listen to the others. I am not trying to raise my uncle just because of what happened, but he told me constantly. He would see the things I did and the paths I was going down, and I constantly thought that I knew better. And I think many young people think that anyway. The young woman I was talking about here, they think they are invincible. And me too. I thought I'm never going. I will never have these problems. I would have liked to be able to change certain things. The story of my past follows me as it does, and it limited me in many opportunities and many things that I am able to do. I don't miss they. But if I could come back 10 or 20 years, I would certainly not make some of the decisions I made. What are you most proud of in your life? B My welding certificates. I am certified by the American Welding Society, and I have it. That It is probably the greatest success I have made for myself and the accomplishment. The people I know say I am. Well, I did not work on cars recently, but they said that I had natural talent for catering and work on vehicles. And I don't see it, but I was told once or twice, but I have somehow started to move away from that. I don't know. I cannot say it for lack of interest, but I no longer feel the motivation. I would like to have a silver pocket and I would do that someone else do it. That's what I feel. Okay, thank you. A farewell. B bye. Bye. Hey.

"RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Internet. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. A it's good. Where do you come from? B Pennsylvania. Well, I was in Boston for a few years, then I moved here about three and a half years ago. But I was simply not satisfied with the quality of my life. Maybe only one or twice last year, I only have to go back there once a year. Certainly safer and certainly more. Well, I reject it because I have a lot of family there. But it is fine. I mean, everyone likes the climate here. How is you easy to get used to living in Los Angeles? B not too easy. I have two very good friends here and I have a boyfriend with whom I have been for three years, so it helps. It is from here, but it has definitely made a little adjustment. A good. Do you travel a lot? B no. What are you studying at school? B Advertising? Communications? No, I'm currently working. In fact, I am not working at the moment. I want to be a naturopathic doctor. By telling me more about it. B so fundamentally, compared to Western medicine, a naturopathic doctor is someone who helps someone with symptoms and does not only treat symptoms, but treats them as an entire person. So they look at nutrition, they look at the diet, exercise, just a variety of things to bring someone to live a healthier life compared to drugs or things that are commonly prescribed in Western medicine. How did you decided to do this? B well, one of the big things was when I got out here, I was exposed to the degree I had never heard of. Sometimes living on the east coast. Well, I am very special about the people I like to surround myself and I don't like to socialize with a lot of people. I mean, I tend to love small intimate groups and I do not tend to like to be in groups who are increasingly large or bigger when people do not take into account the feelings of others. What are you doing when you are annoyed? B I usually try to go for a walk if I am very irritated. How are you going to control your temperament? B I'm generally really good. I really need a lot to spread and shout or become upset. A it's good. When will you go back the last time you are Gued with someone? B see. I was with my lawyer, and it was his treatment of my case. Yeah it was. He is. They are. I don't know. I think they are just a little poor. They are not the best lawyers. How would your best friend describe you? B I have no idea. I am very trustworthy. I am faithful. I care very deeply. So I like to try to help others. And I always like to try to encourage people. I think it's. It would be some of them. Have you ever served in the army? B no. Yes. Barely a few months ago. About the last six months. I felt mental problems that I had never really encountered before. Paranoia and anxiety. And I knew that was not the case. I knew it was not the case. That I could not overcome it for myself. How have you been feeling lately? B much better. I did a lot of yoga and meditation. Sort of seeing things from a different range, or not of the skill, but of a different view. And that helped. But there are certainly moments when I somehow reveal myself to think of the event, especially because the event led me to stop working. Are they triggered by something? B I think I have trouble being in public. I am always dealing with anxiety and paranoia on this subject and it can happen. SO. So, several times during the day, it's when it happens. So I'm not comfortable going out during the day. I tend to go out in the morning and in the evenings, and I don't like going to places where there is only one way inside and a way out. Well, I gradually try to increase how much I am, and I'm usually just. Deep breathing. I do a lot of breathing exercises. And I'm just trying to say that fundamentally what I think or what's going on with me is not real and that I am just. I try. I'm just trying to get into these places more gradually. Much better for the past two months, but before, I stayed at around home. How did a therapist affect you? B It was good. It was good to hear someone's comments, but I feel like I got more help with just my interior conversation with just a little sitting with myself and the journalization. Are you going to always in therapy now? B I do. A good. Have you noticed changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B well, I feel more like me, which is a huge improvement. And I am more prudent and considered in some ways on my thoughts and on my decisions too. I am not the case. I am not the case. Oh, you know, I'm going to do that and not really think of the consequences Other things I want in my life. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B It improved. I'm better now. The first three months were very difficult. I couldn't sleep all night, and I woke up maybe two or three times and I would be awake for a few hours. But now I sleep again all night. I am groggy, I feel misty and outside and just low, a little depressed. R when is the last time you felt really happy? B I think it's been a while. Functioning. I am a bit of a work executioner. Spend time with my family. Yeah, be just outside, enjoy nature, read. How far are you from your family? B very close. What is this? Well, my parents, because they have always been very supported and loving, giving me comments on my decisions or what I choose to do, but allowing me to make my own decisions, my own choice, choices in life. And then my sisters have always been very, you know, I always check with me. I'm the baby. I am the youngest in the family, so they always want me and I check myself with me. And then my boyfriend, Shotsma, with this incident that occurred, he was very favorable to what I do not let myself have my speech and develop things and understand myself when I feel myself and not want to go out in public and be aware of that, that it is not so easy for me to do something like grocery store or make a mistake without having a lot of anxiety. I am very proud of the jobs, the work I have done, the people I helped. Maybe I took this work where I was attacked. That would be it. Entering retail, in this dangerous environment, without listening to my instinct. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B What advice would I be? What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. B to recklessly pursue your dreams that there is nothing too late or to run out of time. And to take advantage of every moment of your life, do not take anything for granted. Something you recently did that you really enjoyed. B see. Well, cook, I really appreciate. I really like cooking. So I made roasted vegetables. Whenever I cook, I really appreciate it. We have a garden, so we had loses that came and peppers and cauliflower. So just use. Prepare this for my boyfriend and me. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. B bye.

A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment.

Your answers are totally confirmation. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing pretty good. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B I was born in Los Angeles. A Really? B Mm. A What are some things you really like about la? B I like things. The diversity of the city, all the attractions and things that you can see, the food, restaurants, things like that. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B Traffic, freeways, crime. A I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel? B Yes, I do. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Seeing new places or going back and seeing same places and just enjoying relaxing, getting away from la. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B Well, let's see. Last trip I made was up to the central coast up in Cambria and Pismo beach area. And that's all. Thanks. Standing is nice. Yeah. A What's not your most memorable experiences? B Probably when I got to study abroad in Madrid, Spain, when I was a student at ucla. In terms of travel? Yeah. I participated in the education abroad program at ucla where you go live in another country to learn the language and you live there for a year at the university and you study at the university and it was just a memorable year, an experience that I would never forget. A That's so good to hear. B Thanks. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Probably more shy, but sometimes I could be outgoing. A Like what? B I'm more shy in terms of, you know, it takes time for me to get to know people. I mean, I'm not a real party person. I don't like to go to parties and meet people and things like that. But if I'm among friends and things like that, then I can be pretty outgoing with people. I know. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish to screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B Drink wine. Yeah. Drink Wine, Maybe listen to some nice music. A Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? B Pretty good. I'm pretty good at controlling my emotions. A That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Oh, gosh, I wouldn't say it was a real argument. It was more like a. What? Just a discussion. Maybe about finances, maybe money. A How did you feel in that moment? B Just. Just a little irritated, but not really. Not really strong. Emotional. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Oh, wow. Gosh. I can't think of anything at the moment, so let's skip that one. A Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? B Um, maybe eating. Eating more junk food than I admit to or. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B The hardest decision I ever had to make? Maybe buying a home or remodeling the home, spending money for it. How did you decide to do that? It was. I felt it was time to move on with my life and to buy a place for myself so I could be self sufficient and independent. A Are you happy you did that? B Yes, very happy. A That's great. B Thank you. A Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B An event I could erase from my. When I. Yeah, when I was. When I was student teaching for a year, trying to get my teaching credential and discovered I never enjoyed it. I want to erase that whole year. 1983. It just brought back horrible. It just brings back horrible memories of what I went through when I was student teaching and discovered that teaching K12 was not for me. A Okay. What do you study at school? B My major was Spanish and linguistics. A What made you decide to do that? B I was very good at foreign languages and I thought I enjoyed taking them and I was just having a good time taking foreign language and I was getting good grades, so I thought maybe this is what I should go into. Foreign languages. A Are you still working in that? B I was teaching. I was an adult ed teacher teaching English as a second language for 30 years and I just recently decided to retire myself. A Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B I have a pretty good relationship with my family, with my mother and my sisters. My father passed away in 2008 and my relationship with my father wasn't as good as with my other family members. Yeah. But on the whole, we have pretty good relation with the rest of my family now. A Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Pretty easy. I don't have any problems. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B If I don't sleep well, I may be moving around in the bed and messing up the sheets, but that doesn't happen too often. A How have you been feeling lately? B Pretty good. I think I've been feeling pretty good. No major health problems or anything. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B No. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B No. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Last time I was really happy. Probably when spring break came around, it was vacation time and it was time to go on our trip. A Can you tell me about that? B Yeah. It was a week trip up to Central coast to Cambria and Pismo beach and Santa Ynez. It was just a nice getaway. Relaxing on the hotel lawn and garden, drinking wine and enjoying different sights and eating good food and. And buying wine to replenish our dwindling supply at home. A That's great. B Thanks. A How would your best friend describe you? B I think she would describe me as kind and sweet and motivated and just a nice person. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Um. Let's say sometimes I wouldn't mind being a little more outgoing. I guess I tend to be more reserved, so I wouldn't mind being more outgoing towards strangers and things. A But tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. B Really badly about myself? Let's see. Probably when I betrayed a confidence with some friends of mine when I taped them. When I taped them singing Christmas carols. And I played it to some other people and they found out and they really laid a guilt trip on me for doing that. Yeah. But it all got resolved at the end. We were all. It was just a bad misunderstanding on my part, but it worked out okay. A Okay. B Is there anything you regret? Probably having done what I did by playing it to other people. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B What advice would I give myself 10 or 20 years ago? Don't give up. Just keep pursuing what you want and never give up. See it as a hint, as a disappointment. If it doesn't work out. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm a good listener. I'm a motivated person. I'm hard working. I'm conscientious, I'm caring. I'm generally a pretty happy type person. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Something recently that I really enjoyed. Going to the Festival of Books at USC this weekend. A Nice. Can you Tell me about that. B Yeah, the Festival of Books is a festival where they have all these books, book authors and they have food demonstrations and seminars and all kinds of books available to look at. And there's lots of food and a lot of authors signing books and things. It's a great event for just to get out. And it was nice weather too, so it's nice to be out there. Mm. Yeah, I really enjoyed that, especially the food. A That's so good to hear. B Thanks. A What are you most proud of in your life? B Most proud of. Most proud of probably being successful in my work, in my life and my marriage and. And just. Just basically being happy with myself. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Oh, you're welcome. A Goodbye. B Bye. Is that it? Oh, okay.

"A Oh, my hair is all messy. B So again, she's going to start up in just a couple seconds after I leave, and then again when she says goodbye, press this button and I'll come back over. Okay? A Okay, thank you. B Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Yes. B Okay. So how are you doing today? A I'm fine, thank you. B That's good. Where are you from originally? A Detroit. Michigan. B Really? A Yes. I moved to la myself in 2007, but my family came here many more years ago. More like 40 years ago. B How often do you go back to your hometown? A I don't go back to Detroit anymore. B Why? A I really don't like the weather and I really don't have any reason to. Most of my immediate family is out here in California. B How does it compare to la? A Completely different. For me, Detroit was just very cold. It wasn't the best for my personality. I prefer la. More open space, a warmer climate, warmer people. Just a different vibe that I like better. B Why did you move to la? A After my husband and I relationship ended. I had family out here, so I thought it would be easier to start over here than some of the other places I had lived or to stay where we were at. B How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? A Extremely easy. I came out here every year to visit while I was in college, so I was extremely used to it. Plus I had also taken six months off of school and lived out here and went to school out here, so I was completely used to it. B Yeah. What are some things you really like about la? A Well, like I said, the weather is number one. It's just less crowded. It's more open space. It's a calmer, friendlier vibe, less rushed. B What are some things you don't really like about la? A The smog would be one, and when I drive, the traffic. In certain areas it can be. But in general, there's not a lot that I don't list. Like, I guess, the overall threat of earthquake. But that isn't really that much of a factor because it rarely happens. B I see what you mean. A The price of real estate, that's another one that I don't necessarily like. B I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world explorer. A I can't see your shoes. I can't see your shoes at all. So I don't travel as much as I used to, but I have traveled worldwide. B What do you enjoy about traveling? A New experiences. B I'd love to hear about one of your trips. A Well, I used to be an international flight attendant and then later I traveled through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive. So I've traveled a lot of different places and I'll have to say they were all pretty much enjoyable because, you know, there's different cultures, different things to see, do learn, enjoy, experience. B What's one of your most memorable experiences? A My experiences, I would say in Europe, visiting more. So I've also visited in South America just because the cultures are so very different. B Yeah. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A I would probably say more shy in general compared to people who I know are really, really outgoing. Although I've had them describe me as outgoing. B Okay. Sometimes what I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? A I like to read, I like to walk or power walk or hike. Listen to music, you know. B How are you at controlling your temper? A I'm very good at controlling my temperature. B When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? A Oh, probably when I was married with my husband many years ago. It could be many things. I don't even know in specific, but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate slash argument with him. It could be, it could be a choice of differently. Some of the instances when I might have been with him and I, you know, got emotional or let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than just, you know, seeing it as not something to respond to perhaps, but it would always be where you were also pushed to answer. So you know, you can't always just say ignore a person there because many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate. But some people, you know, don't respond to the so called norm. If you ignore it, they'll just, you know, de escalate. But that's not always the case. I've taught middle school kids and you can try calm methods with them, but that doesn't always work. But you always have to, as the teacher, maintain, you know, your professional demeanor. So you can't really, even when they, you know, the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or other kids. So. B I see what you mean. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. A Well, that could be several, I guess a decision in along with my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery that, you know, the outcome was uncertain, it could go either way and in that case she died. So, you know, that's a pretty hard decision because you don't know. But you also know if you don't that it could be a very serious outcome for them as well. B Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. A Oh, many different things that could occur. You know, in life you always are second guessing things that you might could do. But they also can be learning experiences. So is it necessarily a good thing to erase them? You know, if you can look at it as positive, sometimes people can have a strong reaction and they don't really look past the impact of the event because there might be something that you can gain from that. But there I grew up in a home of dysfunction, so there was domestic abuse, you know, and there were many incidences. So you can't just say only one because there is lots of traumatic things. But it also would have been a different outcome and say, learning to deal with some of the things that occur in life as an adult that sometimes I see among acquaintances or friends that have not had really strong experiences, fall apart or just have very, very difficult times dealing with. So. So right. B How do you cope with them? A You can listen, you know, because I understand that not everybody's had the same experience. You know, you can walk them through levels of understanding and you know, as you know someone, you have a balance of background information on which to help them pull from and to see that things will progress in a better way. Knowing that this isn't like the end of the world or as terrible as it seems that it could be. And you can also relate other experiences to them of things that were worse or seem to be. And of course there's always in general, I mean, when you look at all the calamities in the world, you know, most of those things aren't affecting us or the people that we know here. So that provides us perspective that, you know, can pull someone out of their, I won't necessarily say self absorption, but the seemingly intensity of their experience right at the moment. B Tell me about your relationship with your family. A Well, we have a good relationship for the most part. There are different levels of stress and Trauma that some of my siblings have experienced. So it has made them interact with life and people more intensely than others. Some have not had as much experience in life that will help them deal with things, you know, in a different way. So it's always evolving, and I walk in positivity as a lead of, you know, the way I respond to try and engender a more positive response from them rather than feed sometimes the very strong reactions or responses or interactions that they may have. B Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? A Pardon? I didn't hear you. Could you repeat? B Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? A My mother. Different teachers, friends. B Can you tell me about that? A Well, my mother has always been a very calm person, for the most part, easygoing, even though she's experienced a lot of negativity. I've had teachers that have been very positive and proactive and have taught independent thinking and techniques to rise above some of the things that were occurring. And just various friends that, you know, I would see handling situations sometimes much more difficult, you know, dealing with things. So. B Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? A It depends. For the most part, it's, you know, pretty good. It depends. If I'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or, you know, you know, trying to get more hours in the day because I need to get things done, then, you know, it's less. But in general, I don't have a problem sleeping. It's just if I make myself stay up because there's more stuff that I want to get done. B I see what you mean. How have you been feeling lately? A I've been feeling okay. Less, you know, stressful in general. It goes in general because I've got several projects that I'm working on, so. But in general. Good. B Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? A Like, I mean, not in particular. I mean, it just seems less stressful as I get more stuff done and the stress comes from. Sometimes they're being a lot more things to do in a shorter period of time, but, you know, reorganizing some of the things that need to be done, you know, can smooth that out. B Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? A No, I haven't, but I know it's something that a lot of, say, veterans in particular have. People have. B Right. Have you been diagnosed with depression? A I have not, no. B Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. A Well, there's several, I guess, and happiness comes in small or large things, but in general. Every day, every moment. To me, I mean every day, every morning, this great wonderful day of happiness. As far as big celebratory kinds of things, I don't have big highs and lows like that. I think it's something that should be on your continuum in every day. It can be a really great meal, it could be a great view, it could be a moment shared with someone. It should be on an even keel. B How would your best friend describe you? A As perseverant. You know, I will continue forth and positive upbeat. B Is there anything you regret? A Maybe not doing things differently when I were younger, like spending my money differently or spending my time, you know, a little more differently. But that's hard to say. It's like, okay, as your kid, older, you can see, you know, you could have done some things differently. Instead of buying the house that I did, would have, you know, waited and bought another one. I mean things like that. B What advice would you give yourself? 10 or 20 years ago? A I would have made myself move to California sooner and I would have instead of buying the house that I bought then. If I'd known, I would have, you know, the situation I have now, wait it to get something different. But you know, how can you have that hindsight? You make the best decision that you can at the time with the best information available. After you have looked at several options. B What are you most proud of in your life? A Of being independent and educated. Able to take care of myself. B That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. A Okay, goodbye. Bye bye now.

"A Set down on this table because we don't want you to hold anything because we got, you know, a lot of cameras here. If you don't mind. B No. A So just you press that button and I'll come back. B Okay? Okay. Okay, thank you. A I'm gonna go ahead and start this recording. B Yep. A The other recordings have started up as well. I'm gonna bring up our virtual human here. She kind of flies in. Just as a warning. B There, she. A Okay, once again, I'm going to leave the room. B Press this button when she says, when she's done. Okay? A Hi, I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to teach people in a safe and safe, secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A So how are you doing today? B Anxious, excited. This is all new to me. A I'm sorry. Where are you from originally? B Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A What are some things you really like about la? B The people, the weather, the food. That's basically it. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B The gangs. Seems to be a like of snooty people here. Kind of stuck up because being from Beverly Hills or Burbank and some phonies that are really not themselves. They're imitations. A I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? B I used to. When I was with the merchant marines. I traveled all over the world. I've been to Australia. I've been to Rhoda, Spain, Norway, England, Scotland. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed traveling. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B Meeting different people, meeting different cultures. Speaking the language. I speak a few languages. Different languages. I speak Tagalog. I speak some Japanese. Speak some Thai. A I'd like to hear. B Well, I spent four years in Japan. I enjoyed living in Japan. The people are very friendly there. I got to climb Mount Fujiyama. That was a trip in itself to travel Mount Fuji. The food is good. I like katsudon and I like sashimi and yakitori. The cherry blossoms only comes out once a year. And I just like Japan. Japan's nice. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B My most memorable experiences. A What did you study at school? B I took engineering. I was in engineering. I learned different things about distilling plants, diesel engines, air compressors. Went through a lot of education, a lot of schooling. A What do you do now? B I'm retired. I'm a veteran, 70 cent disability. I'm retired and I'm waiting on my SSDI right now. A Uh huh. What's your dream job? B What was your question? A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Shy. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B Oh wow. I came from a dysfunctional family. I really don't have many family values. Me and my brother are 13 years apart in age so I really don't know my brother that well. So I really don't know much of family life. We never sat down at the table together and had meals together. It was always like separate times. One would come in and eat, another one would come in and eat. We never sat down to sit same table. So I don't know much about family life. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I listen to music and I listen to religious relaxing relaxation music like chimes, a brook, water running, stuff like that. A How are you at controlling your temper? B I'm on medication right now. I get aggravated real easily, mood swings, personality disorder. But sometimes it just flares up depending on the situation if somebody gets in my face. But I try not to let it happen because I know the circumstances. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B It was on a bus. I was sitting in the back on the bus and the guy came back and he wanted me to move for he could sit down. But I'm a big guy and he's a big guy so I decided just to get up and let him have the seat. I didn't want to get no confrontation. I just let it go. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B That had to be meeting a girl that I've known for 18 years. She's had two children with this guy and now the guy is going to be part of the family and I feel very comfortable about that. But I still have feelings for this girl. But I know that the father of the boys, they're not married, he's going to be involved with the family and I don't like that. A What's something you feel guilty about? B That's a good one. Back in 2010 I went back for my mom's funeral and my brother was hard up for money. He took his IRA out and spend it and I had promised him I was going to pay him back. I wasn't able to pay him back and he held it against me. So I felt guilty about that because I made a promise and I didn't keep it. But there was more circumstances into that and he doesn't understand. He didn't write to me, he didn't call me, he didn't do a lot of things. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B The hardest decision I ever had to make was when I was with the Merchant Marines. I was very comfortable being at sea. And my wife at the time, she wanted me to stop sailing and just get a regular 9 to 5 job where I would have been very comfortable staying at sea and working on ships because I loved that. That was what I loved. But she didn't like that, so she'd rather me work 9 to 5. A Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Dead bodies. I always see a lot of dead bodies. I had circumstances in the military where I recovered a dead body in the Philippines. A boy had jumped ship and we recovered the body underneath the pier and I had to pull the body out and put it in a body bag. And another incident was in boot camp. There was circumstances where me and this guy got letters all the time from our girls, but he was engaged and he committed suicide because the girl dumped him for another guy and it crushed him. And he ended up jumping three feet in front of me while I was in barrack's duty. And I seen his head explode like a pumpkin and it affected me greatly. I see that all the time. A Have you ever served in the military? B Yes, I was in the Navy 15 years and two were the merchant marines. A How old were you when you joined the military? B 24. A Why did you decide to enlist in the military? B Family thing. My father was in the Navy. My cousins was in the Air Force. My other uncle was in Marine Corps. I just wanted to serve my country. A Are you happy you did that? B Yes. I love my country, usa Serve in the military, no regrets. A Did you ever see combat? B No, but we escorted Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf. We had weapons pointing at us while we escorted Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf. But I never saw combat. I was never in a combat situation, never had to fire a gun at somebody, so I don't know what it was like. What I'm traveling through is going through is non combat ptsd, which means I was in a combat zone. A How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? B At first it was hard. I was collecting unemployment for 18 months. Then after the unemployment ran out, I had to get a job So I got various jobs working security and refineries and I tried to stay busy the best I could. It was okay. A I'm sorry. What did you do after the military? B I worked refineries, I worked security. I worked for wineries, security guard for wineries. I did a little odds and ends until I was able to get a full time job. And that was with the merchant marines. I went to the Coast Guard and applied for JMed. I forgot. But anyway, I worked for engineering. A How did serving in the military, Terry, change? B You made me a better person. I was in a scared. When I first joined, I was kind of scared. But then joining the military, it made me a lot tougher and stronger. I stood up for my own grounds. I wasn't being pushed around. And I just like people applauding when you would walk into a place and they would appreciate what you did for your country made it all worthwhile. A That's good. How have you been feeling lately? B Depressed. Mood swings, high anxiety, isolation. I have no social life. I don't have much of communication with women. I don't know how to act around them. So I like to say to myself. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B I'm getting out more. Before I was always staying in my room, but now I'm making the effort to go out to see things. I go to movies, I go out for dinner by myself. So my behavior has changed somewhat. I'm not staying in like I used to, you know. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B It's not. I have insomnia. I see dead bodies. I'm on risperdone and trapezoid, which supposedly help me sleep. But sometimes I only get like three hours sleep. I'm up half the night. I don't sleep too well. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B What was the question? A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Yes, non combat ptsd. It's because of circumstances that happen. Trauma. I was in the Navy and I'm going through group sessions now. On Wednesday I sit in classes and we talk about it. In fact, August 28, I graduate from my class. I get a certificate, so that's a good thing about it. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B A year ago. A What were your symptoms? B Cold sweats, nightmares. Insomnia. Just jittery, always looking over my shoulder. Don't feel comfortable around people, don't trust people. A Are they triggered by something? B No. A Tell me more about that. B I'd like to change. Can we Change the subject. A Tell me more about that. B You're persistent. A What got you to seek help? B What brought me to seek help, brought me to seek help was I got tired of nightmares. I got tired of staying up, got tired being jittery, got talent, cold sweats. I just got tired of all those things being antsy and jittery and just, you know, it just didn't feel comfortable. A Do you still go to therapy now? B Yes, every Wednesday, 3:00, 3 to 4. A Do you feel therapy is useful? B Yes, I do. I understand some things that I didn't understand before. And as a group, there's six of us in the group and we help each other, we give advice to each other, and it works out pretty well. A Can you tell me about that? B Well, we got Marines, Navy, army and Air Force, and what we do, we share experiences of what we experienced. Right now we're going through a lot of problems with our daughters and relationships with the daughters that a lot of times we don't feel comfortable with our daughters because somewhere or another we have done either harm to them or something. We haven't worked with them or worked out with them, and now we're trying to build that relationship up. A What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? B Kind of changes? I'm more. A When was the last time you felt really happy? B Happy? I've never really been happy, Allie. I. I just live day to day, one day at a time. There hasn't really been much happiness in my life. I've gone through a lot of ups and downs and disappointments, and it's been hard for me. I've slept in homeless shelters and slept in garages and closets, so I really haven't had a kind life, you know. A That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Influence in my life. My psychologist. He's been good for me. Tim Morrissey and my counselor. I have. In ptsd. It's been good for me also. I also have a friend over at the. It's been a real good friend for me. We talk a lot and I think we're good for each other. We both suffer through the same thing. Bipolar and ptsd. A How do your best friend describe you? B Neurotic. I'm a mess. He says I'm worse off than what I say I am. I'm just in bad shape. A Nice. B There hasn't been any. I haven't really gone anywhere, you know, but I'm going to. In September, I'm going to Philadelphia So I'm looking forward to see that. That's going to be a big thing for me, going to Philadelphia, getting out of California for a while. So I'll be able to tell you more about that when I come back from Philadelphia. A What are you most proud of in your life? B A woman. I'm lonely. I'm 58 years old, looking for some companionship. But I'm afraid to go out there and ask because I don't know how to act or I don't know what to say to the woman. And plus being on medication, I don't know how she's going to act on that. You know, sometimes I over medicate myself when I take my medication, so I'm not that good of a person to be around. You know, I sleep a lot. A That's good. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B You're welcome. A Goodbye. B Goodbye. Okay.

"A Okay. B Perfect. She's going to ask you some questions. Questions. A Okay. All right. B Your answers are totally. Are you okay with this? A Yes. Okay. You. Englewood, California? Yeah, no, it's okay. You mean my girlfriend and my daughter? Yes. They're okay? It's okay. It's cool. Yes, I do. Well, I'm a football recruiter, so I travel all around the world to sign different football players for our sports management company. Just the independence about it. Being alone, being able to be free and not tied down to one to one thing, you know, it's great. I remember traveling to and take them to clubs and this and that. And we're not that type of organization. Dishonesty. I don't like when people are dishonest. That really, really, really bothers me. And not true, not honest, not real. That upsets me a lot. I tend to just try to free myself from the situation, to clear my mind. Usually take a walk or something like that, or just go in the room by myself and just try to clear my head. I'm okay with it at times, but I can definitely be better. Oh, I argued with my. My lady a couple days ago, and it was about our daughter and some of the things she's doing in school. And she wants to raise her one way and I think I want to raise her kind of a different way and discipline her a little more on certain situations. So I think discipline is a big key in a kid's life, and she was raised a little differently. I don't know. Just angry, upset. You know, when you're in an argument, that's what you feel. So you do and say things that bother you and you just. You go on with it. Yeah, a little bit. I don't know. I just. The way I feel. I don't know. I can't really say just the way I feel A little. A little. I don't know. Just realness, honesty, truth. Just being straight out front. B How close are you to your family? A I'm pretty close. I'm pretty close with my family. Oh. Whole nother subject. Just. They're raised different. I think society's gonna become even wilder. The way the kids are raised and no discipline and the things they're doing, everything they live in, everything's inflated so much to where it's getting to a point where it's getting out of hand. I think kids these days to a certain extent are much wilder than I was and generations before me and just able to do and say. And the lack of respect and, you know, just education wise, it's just. I think it's just tough. Tough times for kids and the way they act. It's ridiculous to me. I definitely like to watch sports. I like to gamble. I like to travel. I like to skate. I like kind of like a guy that likes to see different sites and go different places. I'm a big movie person, so I like going to theaters, stuff like that. I'm actually living it. I always wanted to be in some kind of sports industry, and that's what I'm doing now. I just. My goal is to get a little higher in a ladder and own my own sports management company. But I'm doing pretty well for myself, so I am happy. Yeah. No, no. B How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? A It's okay. It's pretty easy. Irritated? Tired? I don't know. It's been a while. It's been a while. A couple weeks ago. Huh. What did you say? No, not really. I think he would describe me as a standup guy. I try to be a good, loyal friend and an adult. I think you would describe me like that. School. Went to school. Grew up together. Been knowing all my friends for pretty much all my life. Yeah. Very close man. My friends and I are very close. We pretty much do a lot together still at this age. I'm honest. I'm loyal, Very loyal. I am a hard worker. I think I am to a certain extent. I'm just not the average guy. I'm pretty much. I'm a different. Different breed. I just carry myself and act a little different from a normal guy. I don't know, just how I was raised and how my dad was kind of different, and he didn't go with the. In the crowd. And I think I learned that from him a lot. And. And it's just. It's kind of the same path I took. Yeah. A lot of things I regret. I regret a lot of decisions in my life. B Can you give me an example of that? A Yeah. 1. I actually let a lady in my life go years ago that I thought was my soul mate. And we had a big argument, and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break. And that break, I started dating somebody else. And I told her I'm gonna go my way, and she go her way. I think that was a big. A bad decision. Very bad decision. Yeah, totally. I think I could have took a step back and really just thought about the situation a little more instead of being so upset and moving forward. Just upset. I tend to get upset and then My thoughts get clouded. So I need to think a little more when I'm upset. I don't know. Just experiencing time, making up for your mistakes and being better about different decisions. After you made the mistakes, think a little harder about situation, about situations and things. And the decisions that you make, think a lot longer and harder before you make them. And I think the outcome would be in a little different today. My grandmother, she's always been a positive influence. She's a great black woman with old school ways of living. So I think I've added that to my life. She's a great woman and baseball and yeah, I was a pretty good player. I was a pretty good athlete growing up. I was one of the top. And that started a future in athletics, and that's what I wanted to do. So I accomplished my goals. So at the time it was a great thing and still is a great thing. It's a great accomplishment in my life. B What are some things that usually. A Accomplishments. Being able to. If I have a goal or something I'm supposed to do that week or that day and I accomplishment, it always puts me in a good mood or getting my job done, and the way I'm supposed to do it in a timely fashion, it always puts me in a good mold. Being a positive role model right now for younger kids, that's in our sports academy program. I think as I got older, the thought process and the way I look at life has totally changed. And I think a lot of kids can look up to me that I deal with now and say, you know, that's somebody that is a positive influence in my life. Oh, a couple days ago, my football team were in the playoffs, made the playoffs. So it always makes me happy. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye.

"A So now I'm going to pull up our virtual human. You'll get to see what she looks like. I'm going to go ahead and start the camera recording up here. Okay. And I'm going to go ahead and start her up. And again, when she says goodbye, just press this button. I'll come back in for you. Hi. B Hi, Ellie. Hi, Ellie. A Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Pretty well. How about you? A Where are you from originally? What are some things you really like about la? B Well, seeing that I don't live in la, I live in Long Beach. I like that there's activity going on a lot and a lot more people, but generally I'm a spot small town type of person. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B Crime, overcrowding, cost of living. A I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? B As much as I can. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B That's really hard to say. I had a lot of good experiences in the military, a lot of good experiences in my marriage. Different traveling places, camping, raising children. Those are all good things. A What did you study at school? B School, Human services. A What do you do now? B Right now I am disabled and hopefully starting back to school in the fall. A Okay. What's your dream job? B My dream job is to be a chemical dependency counselor. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I'd just say it depends on the circumstances. Sometimes I can be quite withdrawn, other times I'm really outgoing. I guess it just depends on the time. A Why? B Sometimes I'm in really deep thought or have have something going on internally, so I don't really say a lot. I'm more observant at that time. Then when I think there's something that needs to be said, I'm not afraid of saying it. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B I have a really good relationship with my family. We all speak on a weekly basis. I come from a large family, have a lot of brothers and sisters. My mother and father are still living, so I talk to them. My mother lives not too far away from me. My father lives back in. I've got two older brothers that I talk to on a regular basis and my Younger sisters that I talk to lots of nieces and nephews. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fishtick screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I listen to classical music. Read something. Maybe watch a movie. That's a good escape. Read something. I'm involved with Alcoholics Anonymous. I might go to a meeting that helps me interact with others. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Pretty good. I rarely have an outburst. I'm a calm person. My demeanor sometimes tells people otherwise, but I'm a really calm person. People say that I look mean, but I'm not. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B That's really hard to say. It's probably just a disagreement with how somebody was being treated. I'm really. That really bothers me when someone is being mistreated and I don't even really know. Couldn't even really point it out, but I know that's probably what it was about. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B The first thing that comes to mind is when my marriage broke up. I wish I would have just accepted it a lot sooner than I did and moved on with my life. But it took. I had been. I had been married for over 20 years and it was hard for me to accept. To accept the fact that my wife wanted a divorce and I tried to hang in a lot longer and just got myself used and abused. So I wish I would have just grasped that situation and moved on a lot faster. A Uh huh. What's something you feel guilty about? B That when my wife and I took in our granddaughters and I promised to raise them and see them through their upbringing, that I didn't have the opportunity to do that. A lot of it was my fault and I feel guilty about that. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had. Had to make. B Well, that goes back to acceptance of accepting the end of my marriage. That was the very. That was the hardest decision was when I finally just decided that to stop fighting what was going to happen and move forward. A All right, tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Hmm. I'd say that I probably wouldn't want to erase anything from my memory because I've grown and learned from every experience I've ever had in my life. So I wouldn't say that I want to erase anything. Those are the things that makes me who I am today. And I like me today. A Have you ever served in the military? B Yes, I have. I'm a veteran of the United States Army. A How old were you when you joined the military? B I was 19 years old. A Why'd you decide? B Well, initially the idea of having college money, which I was very motivated to go to college, having that money to fund my college education was very appetizing. And also I felt like I needed a break from academics, but I knew I wanted to start up again at some point. But that didn't happen. You know, life happened. I got married and da da da da da. So I'm still trying to complete a college education now at age 47. So almost 30 years have gone by, but I'll get it. A Are you happy you did that? B Yes. This is the best experience. The best thing I've ever done for myself was joining the Army. I still paying dividends. It's my living today. Helps me pay my bills today. My pension that I receive taught me a lot. Got to learn, got to meet people from all over the country, see places that I'd never seen before. Gave me a lot of opportunities. A Did you ever see combat? B No, I did not. A I'm sorry. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? B It's a bit of a struggle, you know, when you're serving your country, you get used to being regimented and having a place to be every day. And then all of a sudden you're free basically and don't have that discipline in your life anymore. So it's hard to readjust. I think it took me a long time, longer than I realized. A That's great. What did you do after the min. Military? B See, I was a security guard. I worked in the bakery at a Safeway store. Then I installed carpets and floor coverings for about 10 years or better. Worked in retail, just a lot of different jobs. A How did serving in the military change you? B It gave me a lot of self confidence. I was never very athletically inclined, but that's the most physical activity I'd ever had. I developed my body, developed my mind, showed how much mental fortitude that I had. Got me over a lot of things. Showed me a lot of strength about myself. A That's great. How have you been feeling lately? B Lately I've been feeling pretty good. It's been going pretty well. I've been very. A lot more active than I had been. I'm searching for an apartment right now. Moving out of my current living situation. That's very exciting. I've just been more active in my daily Life. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B Just along the same lines. I seem to be a little bit happier. The depression isn't there so overwhelmingly. I still have some bad days, but I take my medication and I go to my counseling and everything seems to be working out pretty well. A I'm sorry to hear that. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B It's very difficult. I toss and turn, have night sweatshirts, probably having nightmares that I don't recall. I wake up several times. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B Actually, I'm a lot more. I'm overly energetic. Adrenaline takes over and I zip through my day. Then I'm. Then at the end of the day, I'm exhausted, but then that makes it harder to sleep again. So it's just a continuous vicious cycle. So I don't know what to do about it. I talk to my doctors and they don't want to put me on too much sleep medication. So I just try to get a good night's sleep and just take as much rest as I can. Try not to nap during the day, hopefully having a better sleep during the night. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Yes. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B It's been over 10 years ago, probably longer than that. I don't remember the exact date. A What were your symptoms? B Anger, nightmares, restlessness. I don't recall everything that they said because I have a lot of overlapping problems. So, you know, anxiety. A Are they triggered by something? B Not that I'm aware of. A Tell me more about that. B Well, I really don't know what to say. I guess I'd have to get a. A How do you cope with them? B I talk about it when I'm feeling down. I talk to people, I get out and I do things go and I help somebody else get out of self and be of service to others. If I get it out of self, then it's quite helpful. A That's good. What got you to seek help? B Well, what brought me, what got me to seek the help is I'm an alcoholic and I was drinking and I wanted to quit drinking. And then I had to discover the reasons that I was drinking and, you know, I was drinking alcohol as a. As self. Medication for different problems. And I had to get away from the alcohol and other substances, you know, other drugs. And once I did that, I was able to. I had professionals who were more able to differentiate with the alcohol problems from the other problems and prescribe the right medications, prescribe the right Type of treatment. You know, group therapy, individual therapy. Those things have been quite helpful. A All right. Do you still go to therapy now? B Yes, I do. Yes, I do. I have group therapy five days a week and individual therapy once a week. A Okay. Do you feel therapy is useful? B Very much so. As a catharsis, I'm able to take my old heavy luggage and leave it somewhere and not carry it around. You know, it's like I have this big balloon over my head that's filled with all my negative thinkings, my negative situations, my negative thoughts, everything. And every time I'm in therapy or I'm in an AA meeting or I get to empty that balloon out and not have to carry around such a burden. I get to leave that luggage, that garbage somewhere else and not have to carry it around and have it be a burden on myself. So it's quite helpful. A Can you tell me about that? B I'm just. It's just an excellent way of getting rid of bad feelings. A What changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? B I'm not as depressed. I'm a lot more outgoing. I still have a long way to go. I don't. My feelings of unworthiness are limited. They still are there. But I do feel better about myself, that I like myself better today than I did, say, two years ago. So there's. There's hope. A When was the last time you felt really happy? B Hmm. I can't say. It's kind of fleeting. I don't know that I ever get really super overjoyed. Everything is always so muffled for me. I don't think it's ever really just joy, joy, joy. A That's great. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B First of all, my father. He's a good man. My mother, my older brothers. They're excellent. A How would your best friend describe you? B I don't really know that I have a best friend. I know I have some friends. A What about something you did recently that you really enjoyed? Nice. B I went to a baseball game on a Sunday, went to the California Angels, played the Oakland A's, went out to a baseball game with a sober group and went out and ate hot dogs and nachos and drank Pepsi and enjoyed a nice Sunday afternoon baseball game. That was really a good time. A What are you most proud of in your life? B I'd say my granddaughters. I don't have any biological children, but I have a stepdaughter and then her kids and they all call me. And so even though my wife and I aren't together. I'm still an active part of their lives and I'm very proud of them. A That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Okay, thank you. A Goodbye. B Goodbye. A And you're free to, you know, get up and move around if you'd like. But I'm going to go ahead and walk you out in a second because I want to make sure. Check in.

And I try to work in the way I wanted to manage things every day, little by little. A good. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to make. B UM, I cannot think of anyone for the moment. R which you feel guilty? B UM, I, I would say not to support my friends with their career choices. Can you tell me? B I prefer not to enter it. A good. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B Educators of raw food on YouTube and RAW vegan educators and rehabilitating therapy has been really inspiring in the past two months. By telling me more about it. B well, they believe that the essence of all nutrition comes from raw fruits and vegetables. And this is true with many studies like T. Colin Campbell, The China Study. These sources of information that are very good and I think that respect for real research deserves. At uh huh. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B really easy. I almost understood it to a science. A it's good. How are you when you don't sleep well? B I'm tired. How have you been feeling lately? B has felt better than me for a long time. Can you tell me? B yeah. I think this is due to the transition in the food and in no case have a placebo effect that it is in fact, you know, loosen the toxins and the things that have accumulated during my short lifespan of, you know, toxic choices with food and drugs or anything. R Have you noticed these latest changes in your behavior or your thoughts? B yes. I am less tense and the SS irritable and I have more clarity and more control over my decisions and my desires in relation to what I need, this kind of thing. A it's great. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B Yes, to a certain extent. How long have you been diagnosed? B over five years ago. Lack of motivation. And fundamentally, my symptoms parallel to that of depression. What were your symptoms? B Loss of appetite, loss of motivation, not wanting to do anything, not wanting to be social at all. Be afraid of social situations. And it's the four or five main. Are you going to always in therapy now? B no no. Why did you stop? B I think I overcome a chapter of my life which was the doctor taking control of my health and experimenting with drugs. And I just took another route, which was alternative, and I started to make more juice and try to listen to perhaps what I needed with the help of the Internet and nutrition experts and things like that. Do you feel like useful therapy? B yes. Can you tell me? B I believe that therapy is useful because without looking at inside or having someone to help you do it, it is very difficult to readjust some of these problems that you can have who resonate in the subconscious until you, you know, it has an explosion. Basically, therapy will help overall health, mental health, I believe, for everyone. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B last night, I had a very good vegan dinner with it, you know, tacos of meat and cheese and guacamole. I had some of my friends, and they really liked it. I almost converted them. A it's great. B yeah. What are the things you want to change about you? B I would say, you know, trying to listen to my inner conscience more than my brain wants me to do. For example, my brain likes caffeine and sugar, when you know, my body needs something other than that as an example. How difficult? B it's very, very hard. It is a daily process. In Tell Me on a time when someone made you feel really bad. B I managed money for a trading partner and they found themselves short. And I had to blame. But it was in fact my cracking formulas that made it short. But he was not aware of the change that I brought to the formula. So, the blame concerned me that I may have taken money, and I felt automatically uncomfortable because of my uncomfortable, my uncertainty at the change of formula. One yeah. Is there a Do you regret? B no no. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B 20 years ago, I was 2 years old. 10 years ago, I was 12 years old. I thought to start eating raw fruits and vegetables every day. A good. How would your best friend describe you. B as calm and sad. Maybe smart, talented. To Tell Me on something you recently did that you really enjoyed. B I really enjoyed going to the wholesale food market in the city center of Los Angeles. Can you tell me? B Lots of food, advantageous prices. You can eat and feed a whole family for a third of the price goes to a normal supermarket. So, I really have a lot of pleasure in teaching people how perhaps you can improve, especially in terms of food and what they eat. A great. What are the things that you usually put in a good mood? B eat and watch a very good television show. A good. What would you say that some of your best qualities are? B I am insightful. I can. I can adapt to people. I don't know. I guess I will ignore this question for the moment. A good. What are you most proud of in your life? B of which I am very proud. I would say my global situation with where I am at the moment. I could never have imagined that I would be in such a lucky situation. A it's so good. Good to hear. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.

"Ok, it looks good. Okay, once again, when she says goodbye, you just will press this button and I will come back, okay? B ok. R to start asking you questions. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B of course. A good. So how are you today? B Well, I guess. A it's good. Where do you come from? B New Orleans, Louisiana. A really? When did you move to the? B 2005. How often do you go back to your hometown? B I used to come back often, but more. One why? B Ah, just things happened. A good. Why did you move to it? B well, I guess you are not programmed with this knowledge, but Katrina occurred in 2005. In Wow. How easy did you have to get used to living in Los Angeles? B not really. Can you tell me? B UM, where to start? Just is culturally different. I have a different culture here, it's just a different place. What are the things you really like at? B It is suitable for bikes. Louisiana is not. New Orleans, moreover, is really not. Now they are trying to be, but it's not a success. What are the things you don't really like at it? B Pilots. They are crazy. R I see what you mean. I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B not really. A little, but more. I don't have the money. A little broken. R I understand. What do you like on travel? B just be able to go on an adventure. Let's see me. And it was quite fun. A little frightening and dangerous. Was almost killed. It was frightening. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B travel or just in general? To everything that comes. B I must say that I must say that we were, we were going out. We head for the PCH and went to Laguna and Laguna has this really steep hill and, and on Sunday, it is full of traffic. And I remember having descended the hill and my brakes did not work and I was trying to hit my brakes and try to hit my brakes and they would not click and I said to myself, oh my god. And I'm on a three -way bike, so I'm larger than most bikes. And I am, like, zipping between the two, like, the traffic FIC, to descend a hill, unable to brake. And I go down, and suddenly, there is this car which essentially turns where I try to go. So I turned suddenly in front of this bus and this truck and literally finished crossing traffic, through traffic coming in the opposite direction, then moving the circulation coming in the opposite direction, in the right traffic, always without brakes. And, as, do not succeed in preventing my bike from riding, which is painful when your bike rides. A little bit of trouble. SO. Yeah. Yeah, that's all. What did you study at school? B different different things. Anthropology, visual effects. A little weird, but, yes, I'm just. I have always had a fascination for the film, and I think the way people do things and do things is fascinating. Just as, as, the mentality of the crowd of people in particular. Dream job, huh? I don't know. Just a job, I guess. A good. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B I consider myself more out. One why? B you know, I have never been afraid of what people think of me. Like, people don't like people I don't know. I'm not afraid of what they think. I am more concerned with the people I know and what they think of me, I suppose. So being out of the way does not really affect me. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it is the festive God. What do you do to relax? B I play video games, listen to music. Yeah. Read books. I like to read books. And drawing. Read books, drawing, playing video games. Have I thought about this? Have I forgotten something? Sleep. I like to sleep. It's fun. How are you going to control your temperament? B uh, not good. Did that cause you to trouble? B frequently. Can you tell me? Hobo. Uh, in high school, I pushed someone's head through a locker. Uh, yeah. Yeah, that. It's not good. Never push someone's head into a locker. It is a great way to be suspended. Hmm, I don't know. Yeah, things like that. He just puts to fight. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B Like, a serious argument, I suppose, like this argument. On. I suppose that, like. Like, points of view, such as laws on the control of firearms and control of firearms. I mean, it was, like, last night. How did you feel at that time? B It was. It was an argument, you know, the regulation on the control of firearms. I mean, it does not really affect me personally, but it was, like the last argument in which I introduced myself. It's a bit white You specify, I think. A good, tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B ooh. Um. My whole life. About two years ago, I broke with it, as everyone calls it, my evil ax. And, yes, it was right. It was bad. All. Everything went wrong. I mean, I think I have calmed down a lot since, like, just like a person, as a whole. But, I mean, I was angry and all that. I. I think I went to cycle to, like hundreds more kilometers in a singular day, and I was in a ton of pain. As, later in the evening, I went home, I said to myself, oh, God, as, I could barely walk. And, yes, I think that flee and, like, like an extreme cycling, a wave of cycling was not good, but it was better than, like eating too much and, as, completely too depressed because I was depressed. But, yes, like us. We fought and shouted, and it was. It was not good. For example, we have not fought physically. It was more like a screaming match of death. To Tell Me on the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. B HMM. Um. I do not think I had a difficult singular decision that I never had to make because the mon. My greatest thing in life is not, you know, do not regret. Do not regret the things you do. Regret the opportunities you missed. And it is, as, must have come with me. It is, as, must have done. I had to learn that in the past, like, as, two years, two years ago. I could not completely grasp this concept. And to answer your question, I think that thinking about this, the most difficult decision I had to make is that I would probably say. Probably to break with my ex. Probably. Where to start? Um. My ex was not a good person, just in any way, form or form of the word. She did things with which I was not entirely comfortable, just for people around her and for me. And me. You know, they say that you are supposed to give. Forgive people to have made mistakes or do things. And I'm just. I think there are things you can't forgive people, no matter how much you are trying. And I think there are things that, once done, they cannot be canceled. They are fair. They are. They are as they are. And I think. I think that after what she did, as I am just. That things collapsed after that. It's fair. We. Although we were trying, that's right. It didn't work. I mean, I don't know. I don't really want to talk about what happened. A good, tell me about an event or something you want to be able to erase from your memory. B oh, damn it. Oh, guy. Erase from my memory or just Erase never? Eh? I don't know. You know, it's difficult. UM, Katrina. Just Katrina's experience for beginners. My ex. I guess between these two, it's a bit difficult. I prefer to lean towards Katrina because it was right. That. It was not. I mean, I guess you don't know exactly, but in 2005, this giant storm struck New Orleans, Louisiana. Killed a lot of people, leveled the city. And I lost a lot of friends during the storm. I mean, I'm a bit. I get back, but it's always. It is. It's still there. And I think. I don't know. I mean, you can try to look. You can do your best to try to find something positive in there, but there is just. There is nothing. The only thing you can do is think that it was, like a weird accident and will never happen again. I live in Los Angeles and, you know, earthquakes, they can happen. I'm just thinking, oh, I prefer. Rather, know that it happens rather than not knowing that it happens. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B yes. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B yeah. How long have you been diagnosed? B depression? He is reappeared several times. It is not a surprise. The first time, I was diagnosed was in college, which would have been 10 years old. Well, 10 between 10 and 12 years old. I don't know. I don't know. Whenever I was in sixth year, that's why I was first told that I was depressed. Regarding the SSPT, Katrina, then, you know, after Katrina, it was above all the great thing, I suppose. Having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still in high school, it was not a bit. I was not really looking for help. It's a bit. I had. I have sort of entered my high school, and they were like, here is help because we know that you will need it. And I was like, oh, well, thank you. I didn't really ask for it, but okay, I'm going to take it. Um. You know, just in a way happened. Are you going to always in therapy now? B no, not. No more. Why did you stop? B UM is a good question. Um. Jeez. You know, I really don't know. I guess it's just a little trampled. In a way, it was like, I'm not going to do that anymore. Sometimes. Sometimes it's a lot, how, how do you feel today? And things. And, you know, it's a bit. Well, I feel good right now, but ask me in two hours and who knows, you know? How did a therapist affect you? B UM, I guess it helped me understand that some of the things that happen, happen. And to continue and move with your life, E Sense, just, as, you know, you know, things will happen, continue. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B WOW. Uh, I was. I was lying with my girlfriend. I'm just hanging out. A it's so good to hear. What are the things you want to change about you? B UM, well, to start, I mean, you cannot see when I entered, but I walk with a cane right now because I was struck by a car recently, and I would improve my leg. Let's see. Cane is there this way. But anyway, I don't know, getting less. I would do so that I don't feel the incessant need to sleep 14 hours a day. Because when you sleep, like more than 10 hours a day, it's right. It's unproductive. You waste too much time. Like, I have friends who are like, oh, you know, I feel rejuvenated after six hours, and I am like, how do you do that? I have to sleep, like 12 hours to feel good. Like you can sleep six. You know, as in time of crisis. You know, you can get out of it with four, I have to get away with seven or eight. You know, like that. This is my sleeping schedule for crunchy time. Eight hours. It's fair. I don't know. I sleep too much. But I like to sleep too. I mean. Yeah, it's just the part that slept too much that I don't like so much. A good. How would your best friend describe you? B totally crazy. In the right direction. Totally crazy. In the right direction. I suppose that, as, would also say, as, you know, there are times when I could look like an asshole. And I'm not really an asshole. I just know, I just have problems like everyone else. More specifically, I sprinkle, so it's a form of autism that makes life brilliant. They would also say that I am flamboyant and eccentric, because I am totally. I'm coming. I don't know, I think I'm still alive, so I should live because I'm still alive. And, you know, who knows how long I will spend alive? So I should, you know, live while I am alive and go out and do things and not. Do not sit and be calm. Except when I read and I like to read. A good. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Stop kissing. No, it's a bit messed up. I think I would have said myself at the time, because I knew my. My bad ex. I have known her since, as, I was, like, 6 years old and she was 5 years old. I think 10 years ago, I would have caught myself by the shoulders and say, you see this girl? Whatever you do, don't go out with this girl. Don't trust him. You can't trust. And more importantly, no. Do not drop your guard around her, beak Ause she goes. She will exploit this. And I mean, like, physically lower your guard, not mentally. Yeah, no. Do not go out with her. Don't do it. It is not worth it. It's not worth it. It's not worth pain. It is not worth it. A good. What are you most proud of in your life? B The fact that I am still alive, maybe. Yeah. I don't know. Browse the comic strip, I was quite proud of that. Quite proud to have managed to do so. Just, I don't know, you know, I don't really know. I don't really use the term pride. I don't really feel proud. I'm just. It is more, like, the fact that I am always alive. I am proud to be alive. I don't know if it makes me humble or just crazy. Who knows? A good. I think I asked for everything I need. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. B should I press the button now? Oh, goodbye. All right. By the way, his eyes are really frightening. Oh, just say that. Is that just the way they. B them.

Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it is the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I go on Facebook or I check my emails or I watch movies. A temperament. B Sometimes I'm really good for the most part. But there are times when I feel very stressed and I have explosions of temperature, explosions of anger. I don't know, maybe there are about 30 days ago. And it was my inadequate parental skills. Who seems really difficult. B How did you feel at that time? Ashamed. Angry. Confused. But I also had the impression that I had to make my point of view understand. I have four children, three boys and a girl. My eldest son lives in Mar Vista and he does a subordinate job. He is creative and artistic and has a very good heart. My third son, my second son, because he is my third child, lives in Alabama. He has a daughter and also has a subordinate job, but he moved there to be with his daughter. He is not with his daughter's mother. And he's funny and really intelligent and badly intelligent. And my third son, my youngest, living in Los Angeles, lives alone, working on subordinate work, is in a way to find himself. He is extremely kind and sensitive and attentive and loving. But he tends to be hard enough with himself and has a lot of opinions on many things. R Do you find easy to be a parent? B I love being a parent, but being a parent is not easy.

How far are you from your family? B I'm close to my sisters. I am quite far from my mother. I was close when I was younger from my father, but he died when I was 25 years old. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B My university teachers. Can you tell me? B I think they helped me perceive a different perspective on human beings. Made me more altruistic and more open and less critical. R which you feel guilty? B being poor and unsuccessful? To tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B I think I could have made better choices The fathers of my children and / or stepfathers maybe when I left my children. Can you tell me? B my first marriage, I was really immature and indisputable and I felt that I could not provide for my children. So I made the choice to leave them with his father for a while and it was a regret. And then when I was 36, I was diagnosed with cancer and I had to choose to leave my children again with their future fathers. And until I was improved, I couldn't be a full -time mother. Who seems really difficult. B Yeah, it was. The separation of my children is really difficult. The separation of my children is really difficult. I am ashamed, guilt and remorse because if I had a more stable financial and psychological and psychological basis, I could have had the ability not to have caused them some of the problems they have today. A good. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B sometimes good. I must be really tired. Sometimes not so good. How are you when you don't sleep well? B ineffective.

I think I was diagnosed in 1980, maybe before that, but it was never a formal diagnosis. I tried to commit suicide. Are you going to always in therapy now? B yes. Do you feel presumed? B sometimes. What kind of changes have you noticed since you follow therapy? B I'm not really suicidal. Have you felt really happy? B I don't know. 2006, 2007.

B I have a great ability to sympathize. I am open to learning. I want to learn. I am socially empathetic. I love my children. I am a good friend. What are the things you want to change about you? B well, my depression is one thing. I would like to be smarter. This school was easier for me. I would have liked not having such a weak self -esteem. I would like to be more motivated to participate in areas that interests me. Yes. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B go to university. What are you Proud of.

What are the things you really like? B Food, time and people. What are the things you don't really like at it? B I don't know. There are not too many things that I really don't like in the. Maybe some of the bad people or some of the bad environments of the. R I'm sure you can say it by my shoes. I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B No, not too much. I am not like, in Texas, in Las Vegas, and that is almost everything. Good. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B Catch an airplane in Houston, Texas. Like back and forth to visit my father and go to Las Vegas a lot. Oh yeah. Well, when I was younger, I was going to visit my father because he lived in Houston, Texas, and I used to fly a lot and it was very fun. I was not afraid. It was very fun and I enjoyed it. When I went to school, I studied child development and nursing care. I know that I wanted to be someone, and when I went to school, I did not know what I wanted to be, so I somehow took nursing, the LVN program first, then I did not want to be a nurse, so I changed my major for the development of the child and I graduated. A it's great. Do you still work in there? B No, I'm really looking for work. I'm unemployed right now. My dream work will probably do something, working with children, opening a crèche or something. My own business. How difficult? B in my mind, it's simple, but as in reality, it seemed that it was a bit difficult. Do you consider yourself more shy or out? B Sometimes I am shy, but I am really an outgoing person and a person of the people. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What are you doing relax? B to relax? I listen to slow music. I have in a way, like, I have a calm environment and maybe lie down, watch a little television or something. A fee. How are you going to control your temperament? B I am very good at controlling my temperament. I don't like getting angry or upset or getting where I will hurt someone. A it's good. When will you go back the last time you argued with someone? B When I really have arguments, they are like. Because people do not agree to disagree. And it's, like, really mean. It's like we could say, oh, it's just, like my opinion. And they do not agree with my opinion. We therefore discuss this subject. But it's like, nothing really big or something like that. It's just stupid. I don't even remember. A good. What do you feel guilty? B probably doesn't work at the moment. I need a job. A It can be difficult to find a good job these days. B yes. To tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B maybe I don't really remember a situation. I really tried to think before I really manage a situation, and I try to manage it in my best positive way before I really do something that I regret. To Tell Me on the most difficult decision you have ever had to take. B being with someone. Like a guy, you know, if I want to continue a relationship with them or be just single. R I see what you mean. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B my relationship with my family I don't. I really stay with my father and I have a daughter, and we stay close close to. All my family, they are either in Houston, Texas, or they are there, but I do not really socialize with a lot of my family. My father, because I live with him right now, I have stayed with him maybe about five to six years, and he is just the only one I really look at. I really have no one else around me to really admire. And that's it. She is in fifth year. She graduated. It goes in sixth year. And I'm a little excited for that. R Do you find easy to be a parent? B Sometimes it's easy, but sometimes it becomes a little overwhelming. The most difficult thing to be a parent is to be a single parent. It's just you. You always have someone to bring you joy. I always like to do things with my daughter. It is simply a question of making a lot of sacrifices and that it always brings me so much joy at being a parent. A it's so good to hear. What are the ways that you are different as a parent than your parents? B well, my parents, when I was younger, they lived, so my m OM. I don't know. I am a much better parent because I am more interested in what my child wants to do. I am involved in his life, at each stage. Just. I am really fully involved. My parents were not really so involved. You know, they had a drug problem, so that's right. I had to mature much faster than many other children. So it was just my parents and their drug addiction. I would like to be able to erase this from my memory. How are you doing them now? I’m doing well, but when I grew up, it was just tough. It was very tough. I had to do a lot by myself. They were not involved in my decisions in life. You know, I'm just. I didn't really know how to grow up and be a child and what way to go or anything. It was just as if I was in the world by myself. Yeah. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B oh, it's very easy. I sleep well every night. I can sleep at any time. I sleep very well. A it's good. How do you feel recently? B a little sad, but most of the time, I am very happy. I'm just not happy with where I'm in my life right now. Have you noticed changes in your behavior? B not really. I'm really. I try to think very positive and try to do everything I can every day to look for work and remain positive and concentrated. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B No, I didn't do it. No, I didn't do it. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B The last time I felt very happy, it was when I got my university diploma. I felt very happy. It was one of the best things that. It happens in my life. And it was the last time I was really, really very happy like that. I felt like I was at the top of the world. I just felt overwhelmed with joy. Just. Everything was so exciting for me that day. I was just very, very happy. Nothing can bother me that day. I was very happy. And when I think about this day, it's right. It is a very happy experience for me. How does your best friend describe you. B Now? I don't really have a best friend. I really tried. I am. I tried to eliminate a lot of my friends because they didn't really make a lot of positive choices. So at the moment I'm like, I really have no friends right now. R I understand. What would you say that some of your best qualities are? B my personality. I am a happy person. I am an outgoing person and a positive person and a good mother. What are the things you want to change about you? B insecurities. Like, sometimes I feel like I have a lot of weight on my shoulders or something. I have the impression that I cannot pass something. I sometimes can't go to the next step. Or just feel depressed sometimes. In Tell Me on a time when someone made you feel really bad. B Well, I had a friend, and she was, like bipolar. And I tried to really be her friend, no matter how much she had, but she was not a very good friend because she. One day, she is starting to be very negative and to talk about me as if we were enemies and everything. And that didn't really make me feel too bad about my skin, but it made me choose my friends very judiciously. Yeah. To be just a friend with some people who have no positive things with themselves or simply. It's just when I notice things about people who should determine whether I want to be their friend or not. You know, they could have poor qualities or just bad habits. They could smoke cigarettes or drink, and I should notice that it is a red flag, and I should not be these people. Friends. Yeah. To stay in school, stay positive, stay focused and surround myself with good positive people and stay on the right track. A good. Tell me about something you have done recently that you really enjoyed. B well, I went to a friend whom I have not seen since childhood, and them. It was just a lot of people there, and they had a barbecue and everything. And I really liked to see my old friends that I haven't seen for a long time. And just with my family and some friends that I really like because I'm really always in the house. I really don't go out often, so I like to be with a group of friends and family and have a good time. A great. B yeah. What are you most proud of in your life? B I am proud to have obtained my Ged. I graduated, and I want to be someone, and I am very proud to want to be a better parent than my parents. A it's great. All right. I think I asked for everything I need.

RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B ok. A it's good. Where do you come from? B Atlanta, Georgia. A really? When did you move to the? B in 2006. How often do you go back to your hometown? B never. One why? B I don't like it there. How does he compare himself to the? B oh, it's completely boring and there is very little to do. Louisiana is preferable, I think, most places. R I see what you mean. Why did you move to the? B because I was engaged to my fiancé and we lived in Florida. I moved there to be with him and he likes water, but I like the mountains and I missed the hike and I didn't like Florida and he was not linked. So we decided that we wanted to go somewhere where we could both be happy and also have more opportunities and business and all the great things they have to offer. A it's good. How easy did you have to get used to living in Los Angeles? B very, very easy. What are the things you really like at? B There is not much that I don't like it. I love it. I think it's magic. So many creative people and different from all ages. Shapes, sizes, colors, races, t Mountains, water, city, all the things to do, all the different people to meet. I'm coming. I love everything. A it's so good to hear. I am sure you can say by my shoes that I am not really an explorer of the world. Do you travel a lot? B no. Why? B uh, I prefer not to talk about it. A good. What are you studying at school? B I did not go to university. What is your dream work? B I'm still understanding this. Can you tell me? B I don't know. He can. May have something to do with animals. I have a dog that I really like and I never had a dog in adulthood. I had cats and I think I am a late flowering, so I work on all this conversation. I really don't want a job. I want a determined way to create wealth, not just something to earn long -term money. Do you consider yourself more shy or out? B It depends on the situation, but in general, I consider myself more shy. Although most people consider me out. Sometimes when I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B puts classical music. Music? Classical music if I am exposed, especially stressed. And play with my dog. Take a walk. I think I'm really good to control my temperament for the most part. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B Before coming here, it was just financial stress. To tell me about a situation you want to manage differently. B There are probably a lot of examples. I think I prefer to move on to another question. A good. Tell me about the most difficult decision you have ever had to make. B Yeah, I prefer not to talk about it either. A good. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B I prefer not to talk about it. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B not very easy at all. How are you when you don't sleep well? B I am much better recently, but I have history of chronic insomnia and certain health problems, so it is difficult not to feel most of the time. How have you been feeling lately? B last week? I felt much better. Can you tell me? B Yes, I. Time has changed. Spring has arisen. It's a little hotter. I had more trouble with my depression in winter and I have problems with the cold. And so I didn't do many things that I do normally. And I was also sick with the flu. And in t Last week, I decided that I felt quite better for me to get out of my rut and start focusing more on things that I have to do during the day and walk my dog ​​every day and not to isolate so much and to see more of my friends. So I felt. I feel much better, as if I had progressed and last week, things took a more positive turn. A it's great. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B yes. How long have you been diagnosed? B It's been a while. Officially, it was probably. I don't know exactly, but let's see, maybe over 15 years ago. What made you ask for help? B I felt suicidal. Are you going to always in therapy now? B no no. Why did you stop? B because I found a better alternative. By telling me more about it. B I have been in therapy out of time since I was 18 years old and I tried a variety of methods. And then I started working with a neuro-linguistic programmer and it was really the first person who helped me make permanent changes. And I was also able to descend from my antidepressants. And even if I fought with a few episodes of depression, it was never extremely serious and it was one of the best things that ever happened. How did you decided to do this? Well, I was physically ill of the chronic fatigue syndrome and I had a client who referred to me to this person because he had healed him from this disease. And it is because it deals with several problems and therefore everything is interdependent. SO. So, once I had my first conversation with him, I knew it was the right step for me. How did you feel at that time? B I'm so happy. I felt like me. I felt that I had found the answer I was looking for, that I had not lost hope and that I was like on the new cloud. That I had been suffering for a long time and I felt that I finally found the answer to the solution I was looking for. I was like, it was the best thing I ever did with my life. It was the best decision I never made. I felt extremely full of hope for the first time for a long time. To Tell Me on something you have done recently that you really appreciate. B I went there. I went to a music store because I thought of taking an instrument. I used to play the violin when I was a child, and I wanted to do something that would give me more access to my creative side because I felt that it was extremely repressed. And so I went to the music store to try Going out, to see what it would do. To manage the instrument again and see if I thought it was something I would like to continue. A great. B It was great. To tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B Yeah, I prefer not to talk about it. A good. What are the things you want to change about you? B well, there are probably a lot of them, but I always work to be more optimistic. It was difficult. It takes time, but, yes, I would like to be able to hear my own internal voice better. Is there something you regret? B Yeah, I have regrets, of course. Yeah. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B value me more for me to make better interpersonal skills. Who has a positive influence in your life? B My fiancé is the most positive person in my life. My. My ultimate supporter. He is, I think, very unique, not. Not at all selfish and probably a little too given for his own good, but always has my heart interest, has the highest morality of anyone I know. Would give someone the shirt on their back, is a genius in many ways. And I'm very lucky, I think. What are you most proud of in your life? B that I am not an abandonment. That despite very stressful circumstances over long periods, I have not given up taking risks and.",1,Comfort b ok ok great go start record oop b yeah good bizarre ok ok ok good good comfort b well well like false therapist talk yeah b oh gosh well use artifici intelligent converse explain the work b secur about therapist learn peopl would like to learn to ask to ask us to start us with the pleadings great thing A bit like love the thought feel magic man-crest differentia people people the size of color montage race richness something to save long-term money considering shi outgo b depends on the situation generate considering shi although people are considered as an outgo rather talking about saying the family relationship Ken posit turn great diagnot sptsd B diagnose The best thing ever happened decide B Physical sick chronic chronic chronic chronic syndrome Refer the healing person badly treat multiple transmitter both of the first conversation experienced the right no sense bment bment bment bment b happi felt as a response found look given the hope as a new cloud suffer long feel final.

A Love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. B Okay. A Please feel free to tell me anything. You're. Your answers are totally confidential. B Okay. Yes, I'm all right. Little tired. A Awesome. Where are you from originally? B I grew up just outside of Philadelphia and I moved to Los Angeles almost five years ago. A Nice. What are some things you really like about la? B Weather, for sure. Also, I was a film major and business minor in school, so I came out to be involved in entertainment. A What are some things you don't really like about la? B Traffic, smog. Some of the people are a little flaky, but I generally like la. A Do you consider yourself an introvert? B No, quite the opposite. I consider myself an extrovert. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B I enjoy reading, you know, glass of wine, perhaps. Throw on an old movie, try to get out of the apartment and maybe take a walk. Something like that. A What are some things that make you really mad? B Cruelty. People not using their people, being careless or thoughtless, you know, not really giving consideration to other people when they do things. A What do you do when you're annoyed? B Usually vocalize my annoyance, like, unless I figure it would be really inappropriate in a moment. But I'll usually let somebody know as gently as possible that I'm kind of annoyed with what's going on. A How are you at controlling your temper? B Usually pretty good, but I also, you know, there's like a limit point where I go past and it's like, then I cannot control it really anymore. So I have a long fuse, but kind of a large amount of dynamite there sometimes. A When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? B I had an argument with my girlfriend recently and it was, you know, we have very different communication styles, so I guess I was not feeling heard and she was not feeling like my response was appropriate at the time. Maybe. A Okay. What do you study at school? B I was a film and media arts major and business minor and I actually got my Master's of Business Administration at right Now I'm looking for work, preferably something entertainment related, but I will take anything that will help pay the bills and let me continue living on the west side. What I really wanted to do was to produce films. So that was sort of my concentration in the film major. And I did a couple of internships for production companies as an undergrad and in. In my master's program. And I like working with creative people and developing stories and developing projects and being the person that can go from the business and legal people to the creative people and try to make everyone happy and make some money. A Really. Do you travel a lot? B I try to. I mean, I'm a little low on funds right now, but I really enjoy traveling. I drove cross country when I moved from Philadelphia to la. So I drove down the east coast to Savannah and then all through the south and the Southwest. I've been to England four times. I've been to continental Europe twice. A lot of the islands, Montreal, that's the only place I've been to in Canada. But there's a lot more of the US and also Asia, Africa, Australia. Those places I've not been to yet, but I'd love to go. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B I would say maybe the first time I ever left the country, first time I ever went to Europe, we got to take the train, the Glacier Express, through the Alps in Switzerland. And it was unbelievable with the snow and things like that. And I took a lot of pictures and I don't know, it's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen, so it really sticks out in my mind. A Nice. How close are you to your family? B I'm very close with my parents. I talk with my mom on the phone probably two or three times a week. I just talk to my father for Father's Day the other day. And, you know, he always. He sends me emails of news, things that he found interesting or stuff that's related to film and things like that. I'm close. My sister, I have a niece and a nephew. I'm very close with them. I talk to my sister a decent amount and I always see them when I'm home for the holidays. But they're all in the Philadelphia area, so I'm not physically around them. Only maybe once a year, twice at the most, if there's a wedding or something like that. There have been a lot, definitely my parents, some of my teachers in high school that sort of encouraged me, like my social studies, like world cultures professor, one of my English teachers, my film Program. I did a summer internship program twice, and they had. One of the professors from my Film 101 class was the moderator for that, so kept in touch with him as well. A How do you like your living situation? B I like it a lot better now. My last roommate was only. He was somebody from the MBA program. Also was a year behind me, and he was just a terrible roommate. He just moved out. So I was replaced by somebody else who is young and nice and he has the money for rent and he has a rabbit and he's just like. He's a pretty cool guy. So got a decent sized place. I've got the bigger bedroom of the two and the rent is not too bad. And. And I get to live, like, in the Culver City, Mar Vista side of town, which I really enjoy. So I like where I live and the rent is not bad for the neighborhood. Not at all. But I'm a little broke right now, so gotta get back working again and calm down the money situation, but the living situation itself is fine. A Okay. Do you have roommates? B I have one roommate. Yes. Nice guy. A Okay. Have you ever served in the military? B No, I have not. A Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. Yes. Well, I mean, I guess in college I was seeing a cognitive therapist for a while, but I was never on medication or anything like that, and I kind of got away from it. But last summer, about a year ago, kind of came back and I was seeing the individual counselor at school. I was doing group counseling sessions and they had me on Wellbutrin also. So I guess a year. Yes. A What got you to seek help? B I had a dui, which, you know, all of my drinking, I think was really predicated more upon the depression and not being able to handle that properly. So that was part of it. And then just the stress of school. You know, I was having problems there, having problems in my relationship and, you know, was at, like, a really low point and I felt terrible. So I decided I should probably do whatever I could do in order to get better. A Okay. Do you still go to therapy now? B No, I took a leave of absence from school, so that's not really available to me. But I still go to, like, a sobriety support group. And, you know, going back to school is a possibility, so I might go back to doing the counseling sessions there. But my health insurance runs out in, like, two months, so I don't really have. I won't really have a way to see someone unless I see someone from, like, the Department of Health or something like that. So we'll see. A Do you feel like therapy is useful? B I do. I definitely think that there are people that are probably on medication that are not in therapy that probably should be. I'd rather do therapy without medication than medication without therapy. That is for sure. So I definitely think it's a positive to speak with somebody on a regular basis who is sort of removed from your life and objective about it and just listen. That's really the most important part, is having somebody to listen. A Okay. Is going to a therapist helping you? B Yeah, I would definitely say it was. A Can you tell me about that? B Yeah, I mean, just having dedicated time of like an hour or so, you know, 50 minutes, whatever, to where somebody gets to listen to what's going on with you and offer some possible guidance in that direction, you know, in the direction you want to go. I think is always positive, and it forces you to be, like, more mindful of what's actually bothering yourself. When you have to vocalize it, when you have to look them up in the eye and tell them what you're feeling and try to help figure out why and what you can do about it. I think that's always a good thing. A What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? B My mood has been a lot better. You know, it was a really down black time, that last depressive period, so just thinking a lot more about, like, the future and what I'm doing and the way I'm thinking about things and as opposed to just like, stumbling through and existing, I'm, like, trying to think more about what I really want and what I believe and the things that are healthy for me and all the stuff that it should be, should have been doing before but wasn't. A Okay. How has seeing a therapist affected you. B Just generally improve the mood? A What were your symptoms? B I wasn't drinking often, but when I was. I was drinking to get drunk. I was very. I was very down. There was some weight gain. I was sleeping a lot. You know, I just wasn't enjoying the things I used to enjoy as much. You know, I was worried about money. I was worried about where. What direction my life was headed, which I still am to an extent, but it's not like, bringing me down so much now. You know, I was just caught up in a down period, like a rut that I couldn't get out of. I think it was probably just not feeling successful in the things that I wanted to do and kind of just got swept up in the day to day of like, oh, well, I need to be in school because I don't have a job and I don't have any money. And I'm trying to figure it out and I'll do this internship, and that's not going to really lead to anything. And it was just a very, you know, I wasn't moving anywhere. I was stuck in one spot and I didn't like that. Well, I'm not drinking. Not like that anyway. I'm just, you know, I try to be a little bit more mindful of what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. You know, if I. If I end up back in school again, I'm going to definitely take up the counseling again in the group sessions again. I don't know if I want to be back on medication. I felt like that was good for the time frame that it was in, but I don't want to take something every day in order to feel good. I'm trying to get back in shape now. I joined the local gym and I figure that's going to help me too. But the main thing is going to be figuring out what to do with my life because I'm 30 now, so I feel like time to get the real career started. A Nice. How have you been feeling lately? B I've been okay. Just really worried about the money situation because I don't have the student loans to fall back on anymore and stuff. So I'm pretty broke. Hence doing a virtual reality study. But when I get that sorted out and I'm on a regular schedule again and I'm doing something where I'm secure financially here, then I'm sure I will feel a lot better and I will be excited again. A Nice. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B Probably more positive now. I would say in general, I'm still the temper situation. Like, I'm still the same things that bothered me in the past still bother me, but they're not permanently getting me down. You know, there's just. I would be upset about something in the moment and need to express that and then figure out a solution or let it go as opposed to staying in that funk. So I feel more resilient, definitely. A Do you feel that way often? B Yeah, most of the time. Well, like I said, I do get upset about things. I'm not somebody who likes to keep things inside. But even getting them out in the past wouldn't really get me through them. It'd be something I'd really have to slog through and it would take me. It would pull me down for sure. But now I Feel a little bit more comfortable with feeling what I'm feeling and getting it out and then trying to work through it. Some days I do, you know, but it's not every day and it's not like for no particular reason anymore. I mean, I might be down because I'm stressed out, because I have a problem that, you know, I need to address in life, like my lack of funds right now and, you know, know, trying to get in back shape and, you know, trying to figure out what to do with my education that I have so far and find what I want to do. Like, that's something that people should be worried about. But I don't feel like it's any anxiety or anything like that is, you know, or sadness or fear is dominating anymore. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Um, it's usually okay. I've been going to bed later and waking up later since I've not had a job. So that is something I need to watch out for because I really need to start waking up earlier in order to apply for things and go, you know, meet people in person and try to figure something out on the job side of things. But I'm. I'm sleeping okay. I'm not being sleepless or anything like that. There are definitely some days where I feel like staying in bed sometimes, but physically I feel okay. That sucks. I mean, I definitely. I almost feel like I have, like, cold symptoms. If I only get four or five hours of sleep or something like that, I will, you know, I have a runny nose. I'll feel a little feverish. I'll be hungry at weird times, like, I'll just be very run down, and I don't like that feeling at all. I try to get like seven or eight hours of sleep every night. A Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? B Probably when I was home over the holidays. Yeah, when I was home over the holidays, I got to spend like a week and a half with my parents and my niece and nephew and my sister, and I got to see some of my old friends. I got to see some of my extended family and, you know, just a generally good feeling. And it was also my mom's birthday on the 27th of December, so that was a fun occasion as well. A How would your best friend describe you? B I would say very intelligent, very funny, a little intense, a little bit crazy, but very loyal. Also generally a good person, a nice person. A Is there anything you regret? B I regret a lot of things in my life I've done some things, like the dui. Definitely regret that. You know, I dropped out of the first college that I went to because things were really going badly for me at that time. I mean, I kind of regret that. I think it might have been the right thing to do. But, you know, it would have been nice to be able to finish school, you know, on time and start a career that way. You know, I generally try to behave the way I would feel comfortable sleeping at night afterward. But, you know, everybody fails at something. So anytime I've lied, anytime I've quit something, anytime I've, you know, felt like I've wasted an opportunity, you know, I regret those things like most people do. You're welcome. A Bye. B Bye.

"A What is my hair doing over there? Will I see myself again? It's a little better. So this is mimicking her actual positions. B Computer character that can be controlled in the other room by someone. So it allows someone to have a conversation kind of through her. A Okay. B And then I'll tell you a little bit more about how she works afterwards. A All right. B So I'm going to give you the doorbell over here. When she's done, just push this to let me know. A Okay, thanks. B Hi. A Hi. B Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Sure. B Okay. So how are you doing today? A Alright. B That's good. Where are you from originally? A Originally? Originally I'm from Korea. B Really? When did you move to la? A When I was a year old. B You were very young, weren't you? A Yes. B How often do you go back to your hometown? A Almost never. I've been to Korea once. B What are some things you really like about la? A I love the weather and being by the ocean and the culture has a lot of things to do. The food, there's a lot to like. B What are some things you don't really like about la? A The traffic. It seems like we're having a lot of economic difficulties. And the parking tickets are super high. Sometimes I'm really annoyed by our government. B I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. A Do you travel a lot by your shoes? Did you say buy your shoes? Your shoes aren't showing. I have traveled a bit. I'm sort of traveled. I haven't traveled in a little bit in a little while. B What do you enjoy about traveling? A Oh, just it helps you keep things in perspective about our life here. It's exciting. Exciting. And it makes me feel like I'm really living. Because sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in LA and seeing other places. You realize that, you know, life is about a lot of different things that you don't think about every day. B I'd love to hear about one of your trips. A Well, one of my trips I went. I went to Singapore and then to Thailand and it was when I was with my ex boyfriend and we went to. He was a sales engineer or a systems engineer, but he did well that year. And so this was kind of like a company Thing. So we went to Singapore for a few days and that was really interesting. You know, of course, it's a lot different over there. Not just like going to Canada or something, but they had a big reception the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principals of the company, which was real fun. And after Singapore, we did some tours in Singapore. It was really. It was an interesting experience. It's really clean there and it's really. There's not a lot of crime, but the government is very. It's a little bit imposing, but it was very interesting. Then we went to Thailand and that was almost. It was really completely different because it was like jungle. We went to Phuket, this little island, and it was very primitive compared to Singapore, just in a lot of different ways. It was very interesting and it was nice. Everything was really cheap. Had a massage on the beach for $8. It was interesting. Yeah, that was an hour for $8. B Awesome. What did you study at school? A Well, I'm in school right now and I didn't finish school when I was younger because I had health problems. So here I am. I'm just doing my general Ed right now. I'm going to smc. B That's great. A Yeah, I'm happy. B What's your dream job? A Well, my dream job would be to be a veterinarian, but it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life. And also because monetarily it costs a lot, but that would be my dream job, working with animals in a veterinary capacity. B Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A I think I'm right on the cusp. It depends on the environment and the people I'm with and how comfortable I am. But I'm really outgoing when I feel comfortable with people. And I'll be really reserved if I'm not. B That makes sense. Yeah. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? A Well, I mean, aside from sleeping, I like relaxing things like going for a bike ride on the strand, or if I'm at home just, like reading or a lot of times I can just lay there and my mind might be doing things, but I'm kind of relaxing. B How are you at controlling your temper? A Not really good. I don't have. I would say there are certain things that they can really, like, make me. Like when I see injustices or things like that, then I mean, I can really Feel it. But I never just like fly off the handle or throw things or even, you know, yell. B That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Argued? A I can't really say I have arguments. I mean, just like a disagreement or an actual argument. Like if we just. Well, I would say last summer when. I think it was after a baseball game. There was a group of us and we went to. We went to have shabu shabu after the game. And I think. And I don't know, it's kind of a tenuous friendship. Like she's a good friend in some ways and we're actually kind of distant in other ways. So I don't consider her like someone that I would confide in with any deep problems. But sometimes we just have. She's very touchy and she doesn't have the same sense of humor I do. So I think she had said some things to me during the night which kind of bothered me. But, you know, I just kind of. That's just how she is. And then I guess I said some things that she felt were. Well, she gets really offended easily, I think. But after that we didn't talk for a while. But then we. Then one day she called me up and then we were friends again. B Okay. A But like, she never. She never confronted me, ever. B Had to me. A Hardest decision, it was leaving my ex boyfriend. B How did you decide to do that? A Well, it wasn't. It was a long time coming. I mean, I was thinking about it for like five years. You know, he wasn't like beating me or anything. He was a really good guy. But we just had a lot of. We weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like, disagreements. So I had thought about it and thought about it and we were already engaged, but we had been together for a long time. So I don't know, I was always. It was always on my mind, like, should I get married or should I not? And then finally we were just always having. We were always. What's the word I'm looking for? We were just having these little snippy disagreements all the time. And then one day we had one and I just decided that I was going to leave and I did. B That sounds really. A It was really hard. It was the hardest decision in my life, and I can say that definitively and. But I think it was for the best. B That's good. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. A Probably leaving my job for. Well, to help my friend start A business in Nevada. And I really liked my job. I mean it was pretty good. It was right over at the beach. And when I told them that I was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a different position, which was awesome. And that was really stressful for me because I'd already promised my friend to leave. I wouldn't have gotten the position offer if it wasn't for her wanting me to come over there. It was really, really stressful. And I stressed over it for about three weeks until I actually left. When I went over there, like we had made agreements about how much they were going to pay me and blah blah, blah. When I got there, everything like she didn't remember telling me that I needed a certain amount and the other principals of the company were, you know, it was a hard situation because she had talked with me, but they hadn't talked with me. And they're like, well that's too much. And also they were a different religion and it was very strange. I mean they were all one religion. I was surrounded by Mormons and I don't have anything against Mormons, but it was very different because I was kind of an outsider there. And then also the weather was just, it was absolutely awful there. So I would say that's one decision. It's just a pivotal point in my life and I think that I really wish I had just stayed. B Yeah. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. A Well, if you're going to erase something from my memory, then I would probably say my memory. Like really if I could erase something from my memory, what would I want to erase? Is that what you're saying? I can't really think of anything. I mean even like that, that bad decision that I made, you know, it has value in it. So I can't really say that I would want something erased. Maybe if I was like raped or something and it was really horrifying then I would, but I don't. B Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? A Well, if you're talking about being in a deep sleep, I'm in a deep sleep a lot, but I never feel rested and that's, it's a medical problem of mine. B Can you tell me about that? A Well, I always feel like I haven't slept for two days and there are points in the day, I would say during some days there are points in the day where I really feel alert and alive and rested. But they're short lived. But I sleep A lot. I sleep. B How have you been feeling lately? A Pretty crappy. Physically, pretty crappy. B Sorry to hear that. A Well, thanks. B Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? A No. B Have you been diagnosed with depression? A I haven't been officially diagnosed with depression, but that's usually what doctors like. My sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed. I'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed, but that's the first thing that they try and figure out. They've given me, like, depression drugs before, but they haven't helped with my sleep. B I see. A But I do feel down. B Do you feel down? A I do. I would say I feel down sometimes. Well, my life is very strange right now, so there are a lot of reasons to feel down. I would say that I do feel down sometimes. A lot of times, but it's not. I would say it's reasonable, considering the situations that I'm in. B Okay. Are they triggered by something? A They're just triggered by the fact that my health is not great and it makes life really difficult. But I wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular. B Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. A Oh, there. I mean. You mean for a long period of time or. I mean, I experience happiness, like when I go out with friends or I go and, you know, I find some great new dish I like. I mean, what type of happiness are you looking for? B Tell me about something you did recently that you really. A Well, I mean, right now, my friend just had surgery, and so I'm staying with her this week. I'm really enjoying it. I mean, even though we could never live together, I could never live with her long term. And I'm sure she couldn't live with me long term, but I'm having fun. And, you know, she just. I installed the Groupon app on her phone yesterday because she's been paying too much for laser hair removal. And so I installed it on her phone. And then today she's looking up cupcakes. So she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her as a Groupon deal. So, I mean, you know, there's little fun things like that. B How would your best friend. A Probably ocd. And she probably thinks I'm pretty prissy compared to her. I think that she would say that I have a good heart. We're very different. Probably that I'm. I should ask her. I don't know. We go out, so I think she'd say that I'm fine. But she has mentioned that I'm a very private person and that I know I knew before she said that. Why? Well, I told you I have a lot of problems right now, and so I don't really tell people about them. It's kind of a. It's kind of a killjoy. But also, people can feel. I feel that people can feel less comfortable if they perceive that you have a. Have difficulties and they feel kind of. It's just uncomfortable, like, oh, they maybe they should help or they feel guilty, but they have busy lives. So just kind of creates a gap. But I would say even before. Even before this difficult time in my life, I've been a private person. I don't know why I think. I think a lot. I'm a deep thinker. And maybe it's just, you know, not like I feel like I feel abnormal, but maybe I just have a lot of thoughts that don't seem. It doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or. I'm not sure. B I see. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A 10 or 20 years ago? Well, one thing that I regret right now is I haven't really found somebody to spend the rest of my life with. So I would tell myself to concentrate more on that because once you hit 40, it's a lot harder. That's it. B What are you most proud of in your life? A I would say that I've persevered. I'm very proud that even though I have a lot of difficulties in my life, the fact that I'm, you know, making this commitment to go to school and I'm doing it on my own and, you know, it's. It's kind of if people. If people knew all the problems that I have, they'd be like, well, you know, why are you worrying about school? But I really feel that I'm doing this and I'm really proud that even through everything, I'm getting as. B That's great. A Thanks. B I think I've asked everything I need to. A Okay. B Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. A Thanks. B Goodbye. A Bye.

"A good. And I'm going to do something that looks a little funny. B So now I'm going to start with it. A virtual human and she will chat with it. B you a little. All right. R When she has finished, she will let you know. She will say goodbye. B ok. And I'm going to give you the doorbell and you can ring this one. All right. Excellent. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B I'm fine. A it's good. Where do you come from? B here? Los Angeles. A really? What are the things you really like? B There is a lot to do. I love the beach. I love it's sunny all the time. The number of people. That's really almost everything. The number of people. R do you travel a lot? B just a little. What do you like in travel? B I just like to go to new places and discover new things. To I would love to hear about one of your trips. B I recently went to New York. I was there for about three months and it was extremely boring. I went to the west of New York and it was extremely snowy and I was in a position where I did not have a car, so I couldn't go well. And I was in a small town, so it was beautiful for what I could see. But really, there weren't really. Yeah. Do you consider yourself an introvert? B both. I am both introverted and extroverted. I really like doing things by myself. I have a lot of mine, my tastes and aversions, and I spent a lot of time alone, even if I have a lot of friends. And when I go out, I tend to meet a lot of people. But I also like to be a lot alone. A good. How would your best friend describe you? B probably outgoing, creative, talented, fun, trustworthy. What did you study at school? B I studied language, physics and mathematics. No, I'm not. I'm actually. I try to be an actress. How did you decided to do this? B It was something in which I fell when I was a teenager and I really liked doing it and I hadn't done it for years, so I thought, why not? I just returned to California and I could also try something that I really liked to do. Are you happy that you have done that so far? I have just been picked up by an agent, so I didn't really do Everything that is adult. But I hope, hoping for something. It will be fruitful. Part of this was a positive influence in your life. B I really don't do it. I didn't have too much, I guess. My sister, she succeeded very well. My boyfriend is a very positive human being. But really, I didn't have too many positive influences. How far are you from your family? B I'm close. I mean, we hang out. I'm not telling them everything. They are a little judgment, but other than that, I mean. I mean, we hang out. I mean, I see them every day. What are you doing to relax? B Geez, it's a bit difficult for me when you relax. I mean, I try to watch television and I read a lot. That's probably almost everything. I read. I sleep a lot. I'm a little depressed, so yeah, it's a bit. As I said, it's really difficult for me to relax. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B is not. I tend to think a lot about the things that stressed me. I experienced a lot. Lots of things. SO. Yeah, so I don't sleep very well at night. And if I fall asleep, I wake up overnight, usually with a kind of anxiety crisis. Have you triggered by something? B I dream a lot of what has. Assigned me over the years. So that's. Usually, I will dream of something that stressed me, then I will wake up and my chest will hurt or simply. I can't sleep all night because I'm just thinking. I seem to be. I don't know if I'm afraid of falling asleep, but me. I'm just. I don't know. I have the impression that it is a vulnerable place for me because of the things that happened to me. So sleeping is not really something that I do well. How are you when you don't sleep well? B tired. I'm in a bad mood. I am very sensitive. I'm just a negative person, which is really. It's not me. I. Yeah, the judgment is not me either. I'm coming. I am not a nice person to be there. How do you face them? B I tried. I spend a lot of time reading. I try to go out and do. I force myself to go out and do things just to keep myself involved so that I do not just sit down and dwell on the fact that I cannot sleep. And I try to exhaust myself as exhausted as possible by flowing and doing things. How difficult? B it's difficult. I do. Like, there is a part of me that does not want. I don't really want to go out and do things. I really have to force myself. If I made an appointment. I make appointments, like, for auditions or even to do it. I am. I tend not to, like, He at the last minute, I will try to convince myself not to go, but I force myself anyway. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B yes. How long have you been diagnosed? B I was diagnosed for two instances. I was diagnosed approximately three or three years ago, then I was diagnosed again in August. To what made you ask for help. B the first time? It was. I was simply not because of the non-comment and the. Just incredible stress. And then the second time, it was once again that I started with the non-friend. And then every moment of the day was only thinking about what happened to me. And I'm just. I couldn't bear it anymore. So I thought I was getting too dark. I made, like, not to think that life was worth it. And me. I just needed to see someone before something intensified. Yeah it was. Are you still in therapy now? No. Why did you stop? B One of the reasons why I went to New York was to try to get out of my environment. And. And that seemed to help. And I was here. I'm coming. The advisers I was going to really seem to help me a lot. They are fair. They just seem to give me a lot of medication, and I don't think that's what I needed. Yeah. So, yes, stressed. Lately, I was really sad. And I don't know why, but as I said, I tried to fight this while taking care of myself. R when is the last time you felt really happy? B In fact, I'm a few days ago. I was really very happy and it was really happy. But then, he returned, you know, to start feeling miserable again. So can you tell me? Well, I realized that I got up in the morning. In fact, I had a good night's sleep, and I realized that I am really very lucky because I have lived a lot in my life, and I have someone in my life who really loves me and someone who is finally there for me and, you know, gives me what I need emotionally, and I was really grateful for that, and it made me really happy. It's so good to hear. Yeah. THANKS. What are you most proud of in your life? B oh, damn it. I had so many years of fair. Just bad. Just a lot of trouble. It's been a long time since I’ve been proud of anything. I suppose, if something is my ability to survive through all the difficulties I have experienced. A lesser person, I suppose, would have got rid of themselves a long time ago. But even if, like, I am really depressed and I feel dark and I just feel missed About many things, there must be a silver lining. SO. So, yes. So, I mean, I suppose that is what I am proud of. Although a lot of bad things happened to me, it didn't ruin me. I always try to be a good person. I try not to be negative towards others and truthful. And I always have a trip in me. A it's great. B yeah. Is there something you regret. B so? My last wedding does not go out when I should have, and just. I regret a lot. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago. B that any situation that would have had a red flag, just get out of him. You know, some things just don't work. And it doesn't matter how much you try, it doesn't matter how much you put it. So I would say it to myself. That it is not selfish to let go of a bad situation. And not everyone can be helped. So sometimes you have to live for yourself and help yourself. So I had known that then, if I had known that, then I would probably have done better in life. SO. R I see what you mean. B yeah. What are the things that make you really crazy? B people who. When people are on me for my faults that I have done, that I have things that I have done in my past that people always relive when I try to forgive myself. People who are bad for others, people who speak badly of people behind the back, people who are unworthy of confidence. Just anyone who attacks the little guy, you know, people who do not care about the environment or animals. I think everyone should be as good as possible. And it's discouraging. And it drives me so crazy that people can't be people. Don't let people live. People try to make everyone feel as negative and as badly as possible, and it drives me crazy. What are you doing when you are annoyed? B I sell. Yeah. I tend to let off steam. And then. And then. And then it's generally over. I try not to do a badmouth. I'm trying to speak right until. Until he left, then it doesn't bother me. A it's good. How are you going to control your temperament? B I'm trying not to get angry because I have a very bad character, and that. And it can become uncontrollable. So what I do is that something makes me so crazy, I tend to go for a nap. If I am not in this situation where I can simply go take a nap, I generally go away from the situation and I try to empty my mind and come back to it. A good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B It was a few days ago. It was actually with my Mothe r. It was roughly. In fact, she thought I had taken a shirt of her and that she was crying and shouted on me, and I was tired. I was. It was late. And I started screaming on her because I was injured that she would accuse me of something so mean. And it comes back to my past when I was younger and I did not care about people, and I would take and do everything I wanted, and I am not. I'm so far from that person, and it hurt me. So I went crazy and started screaming and chatting, a little mean and stupid. But at the time, it seemed viable. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B HMM. One of my most memorable experiences. I got so much. Maybe it was. I don't know. Um. It was probably a graduated pharmacy school. A it's great. How did you feel at that time? B I felt pretty good. I did not know if I was doing very, very well or not. And I ended up getting, like all my last results to the tests. I ended up getting, like 98%. And I'm actually. I had no confidence that I had done it well in class and school. And I didn't even know how I got the notes I received. So it was a great success for me. And. Yeah, it was great. It was a great memory. Yeah. A great. B yeah. Do you know that you are some of your best qualities? B I'm reliable. I am talented. I am a good listener. I'm still here to help people. I tend to always try to do the right thing. Sometimes, in fact, I forget that I have good qualities, but I'm just all around. I try to be so good and the best person I can be for others and myself. Yeah. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood. B goes to comedy shows, just have moments when you just laugh with people. Sometimes reading puts me in a good mood. I don't know. Probably. That's almost everything. All right. R I think I asked for everything I need. B ok. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. B Thank you. A farewell. B bye.

A Tell Me on your relationship with your family. B I let them do their own thing. I just lost my wife 3 years ago today in Georgia. That's why I came back here.

R Have you noticed these latest changes in your behavior or your thoughts? B not really, no. How easy is you to have a good night's sleep? B I don't sleep very well at all. I have a lot of pain in my arm. A I am sorry. For what? B is just my. My arm. You enter the right position, sleep a little, but you move a little and you have a lot of pain in your arm. So sleeping, just, you know, could sleep for an hour, but I’ve been in this model for some time. How are you when you don't sleep well? B in the same way if I sleep well.

And maybe I was I feel sorry for myself at the time, but I just embarked on a hole and I had to spread myself. And I knew it had to improve one day. SO. How do you face them? B one day at a time. By telling me more about it. B She was always in my mind, every day, thinking about what I could have done for her, but I couldn't do anything for her. What made you ask for help? B just needed a little help to get out of the rut in which I am. And now I go out. Now things improve. On the right side. One huh? Are you still in therapy now? B no no. Why did you stop? B They told me the bad things I didn't want. If I hear. Excuse my language, they said that the mourning period was two or three months, you know, and I still think of my father, and he died 10 years ago, you know, I said, who. Who said that this period of mourning lasts so long? Then they told me, the book says that. And I said, you take your book and push it, because some people, some people must cry longer than others. You know, like that. Do you think therapy is useful? B No, I don't think. I think you have to face your own problems. If people. All people have different problems in mine, you know, just overcome them. Tell me about this, on the surprise of the last 10 years. My father, my older sister, my older brother, my mother and now my wife. Over the past 10 years, it has been difficult. It was really difficult for me.

A Again, when she says goodbye, press this button and I'll be back over. B Cool, thanks. A Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today.

B I'm good. How are you? A I'm great, thanks. Where are you from originally? B I was born in Hawaii, but I grew up in Colorado. A Really? B Yeah, yeah. A When did you move to la? B About seven to eight years ago. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B I try to go back once or twice a year. A How does it compare to la? B It's. How does it compare to la? It's different. It's not as busy. There's more things to do outdoors in the mountains. My fam for work. A Are you happy you did that? B Yeah, I am. I love it here. A That's good. How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B It took about a year before I really felt comfortable. But once I got through that kind of hard year, it was pretty good out here, a good time. A What are some things you really like about la? B I love that I can go to the beach. I love that it's warm most of the time. I love that I've met a lot of people that love the arts as much as I do. The traffic, just like everyone else. Yeah, yeah, the traffic. And it's pretty much just traffic. Earthquakes. A Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B Not as much as I'd like. A What do you enjoy about traveling? B It's just nice to go someplace new, experience something different. A I'd love to hear about one of your trips. B Well, I went to Alaska a couple years ago and that was really awesome. I got to go fishing in the ocean and I got seasick. That wasn't awesome, but it was cool. I saw a bear. In real life, a bear walked through a yard. It was really different than la. It was really cool. A Nice. What did you study at school? B English. Creative writing. A How did you decide to do that? B Well, I always wanted to tell stories, so it just made sense to work on writing in somehow some aspect. A Are you still working in that? B Yeah, I am. A What's your dream job? B To have my own TV show where I write it and everyone watches it every week, and it's awesome. Really hard. A Why? B Because there's a lot of people that have the same dream, so. Yeah, that makes sense. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B More outgoing than shy. A Why? B I like talking to people. I enjoy other people. A Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B Go to the movies or turn on music? Dance. A Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? B Pretty good. A That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? B It was at work about a month ago. I got mad at someone because I didn't think they were. They were giving me clear instructions. And so when I tried to have a conversation about it, they got mad, and then I got mad and we got mad. I felt like I wasn't being heard or listened to, and I felt like we weren't able to have a real dialogue. So because we couldn't have a dialogue, I felt like no one was listening to me. A Yeah, that sucks. B Totally. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B I, I. No regrets? No. I guess I don't know if there is one. I mean, I'm sure there is, but one time I was driving behind someone and they cut me off. And I think it's just been one of those days. This was like a year ago or two years ago. It was just one of those days where I just didn't want. Or I just. It had been a frustrating day. And when this person cut me off and I almost got in an accident with them, I just followed them to their parking spot, and actually I had honked at them, and they. They flipped me off. And so it just really, really got under my skin that someone would cut me off and almost cause an accident and then. And then flip me off. So I. I followed them to the spot and I asked. I said, miss, why did you flip me off when you cut me off? And. And she said, oh, you know, I'm. I've had a rough day. I don't need your attitude. And her daughter was with her, and I told her, well, you're not really setting a very good example for your daughter. And, you know, I Didn't need to be petty like that, but I just. I wanted to be, I guess. A Yeah. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Ooh, look at you going deep. I guess the hardest decision was coming out to my mom, telling her I was gay. I mean, it wasn't hard because it was the right one, but it was hard to do because my mom was very conservative, and she. She had trouble accepting it. And it took a while, but once she did, you know, everything was better. And I knew it would be, but it was just hard in the moment to, you know, tell her something she didn't want to hear. When I was a little kid, my. My grandfather found our dog run over on the. On the road, and he. And brought it in. And I remember as a kid, just like, seeing death like that really just threw me off and frightened me. And it was just one of those moments that I guess I wish I hadn't been there for because my grandmother was destroyed. She was just so sad and just one of those moments, I guess you need as a kid. But I didn't really want to experience, like, loss like that in your face. Yeah. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B My relationship with my family is pretty good. We're probably not as close as most, but we, you know, we always. We don't talk often, but we talk with love, and we always love each other when we see each other. A That's so good to hear. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B My grandmother was very positive. She was always very encouraging and told me to, you know, pursue my dreams and not to let the little things get me down. So I'm glad I had her. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Usually it's easy. Sometimes it's not. A Can you tell me about that? B Well, I've been between jobs recently. I start a new job next week. But while I've been off, well, I haven't been working. I tend to, like, my body wants to stay up later and later and later. And I'm trying not to, like, fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like, 2 or 3 and getting up at, like, 11. So I keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like, midnight or 12:30, and I just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half when I should be. I should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like, 9, but still want to stay up, I guess. A little scatterbrained like today I'm a little scatterbrained because I. I tried to go to sleep early again and I ended up tossing and turning and so scatterbrained. A How have you been feeling lately? B Well, since I've had a lot of time on my hands, like, I don't usually have this much time on my hands, so sometimes it can be frustrating because you don't know what to do with it when you're not working, I guess. But yeah, I think that answers the question. A Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B I just thought maybe I'm a little more absent minded than usual. Just lately with the not working thing. A Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B A couple days ago, when I got my new job. When I got hired. A That's great. How do your best friend describe you? B Outgoing, listening, Attentive. Fun. Loyal. I think. I hope. I wish that I. I probably wish that I looked better. I wish I had more hair up here. Losing it a little bit. Probably wish I was a little skinnier. This girdle's pretty tight. And you know, sometimes I wish I had more money, but nothing too drastic. I'm okay. Yeah. A Someone made you feel really badly about yourself. B Oh, when I was a little kid, I was, I was the. I was the fat kid. And gosh, I remember I was like, I was going into high school and it was like the second day. And I remember this guy came up to me and was like. He was like pretty nice to me, I thought. And then I didn't realize he, like, this is like out of a movie, right? Like, he had put band aids on my back that said like, I'm a fat cow. And said like, yeah, like just a bunch of mean stuff. And I didn't know. And I walked around with it for like half an hour. I heard people laughing and I didn't get it. And then finally this girl just came up to me and was like, hey, there's like band Aids on your back that sell these mean things. And then she just walked away. She didn't like, help me take them off. And I remember like, I couldn't get him. I was trying to find him. And then I just remember like putting my head in my locker and like, I didn't want anyone to see me cry. So I just like put my head in my locker and like pretend like I was looking at stuff in my backpack. But really I was, you know, the crying Fat kid who couldn't get the mean stickers off his back. Yeah. A Is there anything you regret? B Anything? Um, probably, yeah. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Um, you know, I would. I would try to keep. I would try to let myself know, to. To look at things positively and to not, like, worry what other people think about you. I think I spent too much time as, like, a adolescent worrying what people thought of me. And as I got older, I didn't care as much and I started enjoying life a lot more. So. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B I went to Coachella. It's a music festival. It was three days with all of my friends and my boyfriend, and we. We danced and we went swimming and we barbecued and we laughed and had a great time. A Awesome. B Yeah. A What are you most proud of in your life? B Oh, I guess my career. Humble as it may be, I really stuck in LA a long time. When it was hard, I stuck around. I didn't quit, you know, I'm proud that I've managed to, like, follow my dreams and really stay out here and try to make it in Hollywood. A That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B My pleasure. A Goodbye. B Goodbye. Bye. Bye. That was fun.

"A So when she's done, she'll say goodbye. And you're going to press this button and I'll come back in. B Okay, great. A Thank you. B Thank you. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started, and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm doing pretty good. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B I was born in Brooklyn, New York. I came out here when I was seven and I've been here ever since. I don't consider myself anything but a Californian. A What do you study at school? B I'm a welder. A How did you decide to do that? B I just. I don't know. It was something about making and building things and repairing things that intrigued me, and I was actually pretty good at it, so I stuck with it. And that's my profession. A That's great. What's your dream job? B Gee, I really never had that. I've just kind of always hoped that I would have a job that could support myself and my family, and I was satisfied with that. A I understand. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B Well, I just recently lost my uncle, and he raised me since I was 7 years old. And other than my wife, I don't have any more family. He passed away last July, and I'm starting to get over it. I knew the day would come, but he was my last living relative, so I've been depressed about that. But I'm doing better. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B It depends on the atmosphere. If I'm around people that I don't feel comfortable with, I'm kind of reserved. But if I'm comfortable and I feel like I fit in, I'm outgoing. A Feeling tense. I turn on the fish tank screensaver. I know it's not polite, but it's the best I've got. B Right. A What do you do to relax? B I enjoy old movies. Old? Well, it's called Film noir, and I love those old black and white movies. And I get on Netflix or Amazon and I try to pick a movie that from back then people were different and they. I don't know, it's just a different era and I enjoy it. A Awesome. How are you at controlling your temper? B Well, my wife says I probably not as good as I think I do. But I've got to admit, sometimes I lose my temperature. And it is, according to her, over things that I shouldn't be losing my temper about. But I'm working on it. And I have basically had this problem ever since I was a young child. Oh, yes, I've been in and out of trouble with the law when I was much younger. I'm past that point now. But, you know, when you're young, you think you know everything and you know you're never going to get old and the future doesn't matter. But it does matter because everything that you do when you're young follows you for the rest of your life. And I don't regret things that I've done. But if I could go back, I definitely would make different choices. Oh, me and my wife, we. We don't argue, we disagree, and it's. She's very strong willed and she's a match for me. So we go back and forth, but, you know, we don't get violent and we don't say meanful things or hurt each other. We're just. She is a determined, strong willed woman and I am who I am. So we kind of go back and forth. And lately I have been the one to bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because in the long run, it just hurt me and there's nobody else more important to me. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. B When I was younger, I wish that I didn't follow some of the people that I followed. And what I mean by that is, you know, running in a circle with certain people and having an ego bigger than my common sense. And that's what got me into trouble. I was an only child and I kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and getting the girls to laugh or having people think I was, you know, cool or whatever. You wouldn't think that now I'm kind of overweight and balding. But when I was in my 20s, I was a completely different person. And if I would have had some brothers and sisters, I may not have thought or acted that way. But I was an only child. So I, you know, ran where people thought I was cool and that got me into trouble. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Hardest decision I ever had to make was giving the authorization to had my uncle pass away. He was on life support and his kidneys had failed and the doctor said there was nothing more he could do. And to not have him go through any suffering to let him slip away. And as you can see, I get very upset. My uncle raised me like his own son and never let me down. And he's gone. And for lack of a better word, to push the button. I never thought I would have to do that. But as I said, I'm getting over it. And things are getting better slowly. My wife, she is always there for me. She will always surprise me. She's not my wife. She's my best friend. And she knows me better than I know myself. We enjoy doing simple things. It's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to, but we mesh. We enjoy each other's company. We like the same things, and we, you know, occasionally go out and do something together, but we. We just enjoy each other's company. And she, like I say, knows me better than anybody, and it surprises me sometimes. A That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B You know, lately. Well, I can't say lately if I don't. Excuse me. If I don't do a rigorous activity or something that really stresses me or strains my body. Let's say for a couple of days, I'm just very relaxed and, you know, not doing much. I just automatically get up after four and a half, five hours. I mean. And, you know, my wife will say, you know, God, you're not getting any sleep. But, I mean, I don't feel tired. I don't feel exhausted. I don't feel like I need to go back to sleep. I'll stay up all day and I'm fine. And most people will say that's not enough sleep. But, you know, for me, I'm. It doesn't affect me. A How have you been feeling lately? B Well, I wish some things could be different, but I'm not dissatisfied. I'm happy with my life like with anybody else. There's a few things that I wish were different, and I think that's in everybody else's, you know, life, but I'm content. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or. B Yeah, I feel a little less motivated. Recently? Well, I can't say recently. This was back in January. My wife and a few friends were noticing that I was becoming forgetful and I couldn't remember things. I didn't see it. And, you know, when they. When everybody brought it to my attention, then I started to. Anyway, I went to the doctor and they gave me the tests, and apparently I have mci, which is mild cognitive impairment. And I've over the Last month or so. Nobody has mentioned it to me. I mean, maybe I'm getting better, but the neurologist that I saw is having me come back in a year and going to retest me. Hopefully it's not the beginning stages of Alzheimer's. I'm still a little young for that. I'm only 52, but I was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and it could have been due also, I was told by him, because of the death of my uncle, I could have been very depressed and I was not able to retain things. And so I'm going back in a year and we'll see if I'm any better. A How do you cope with them? B I'm sorry? A How do you cope with them? B I'm not understanding you. I'm sorry. A Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? B No. No, I have not. Yes, 2001. I was in a. What is the word I'm looking for? I was in a. In a state of mind of where I was just going to get myself in trouble and. And not benefit anything if I didn't seek. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder. Worrying and thinking too much about things and thinking the worst. And I take medication for that. Well, you know, it's not really therapy. It's, you know, every few months, you know, you got to see the doctor, you're doing fine, everything good. And, you know, they just refill your prescription. It's, you know, it's, you know, kind of like the next person. Next person. It's. I'm with Kaiser, so it's. It's. They'll talk to you, but it. They give you the impression that, you know, okay, let's move along. You know, they'll hear your explanation, but, you know, they don't have all the time for you that you may want. So I'm doing fine, though. If I really needed help, I would. Would do something. The medication works for me. A Okay. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Last time I felt real happy. Well, it would depend on what the event is. I'm always happy when I'm doing something with me and my wife and we are enjoying each other. And, you know, I'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and I don't have anything else. She is my world, but I enjoy being with her and we do things together. And I'm happy all the time when we're doing that, when I'm outside of that circle. I don't know if this sounds right, but I'm not seeking happiness I can only explain it as I'm content, I'm not disappointed or I'm not wanting anything. I'm, you know, whatever comes my way is fine. So. A How do your best friend describe you? B Well, I don't know. I. I couldn't give you that answer. Well, my best friend is my wife, but she would describe me as. I don't think before I speak. I let the littlest insignificant things bother me and I get angry over. But the big things, it's like I let it go. And she's bewildered by that. Years and years ago, she, I had a classic Pontiac LeMans and she had gotten to a minor fender bender and she thought it was going to be the end of the world because that was my baby and I, you know, hey, don't worry, we'll get it fixed. And she, she thought I was going to hang her or something, you know, because that was my, this was, you know, it was my baby. And she goes, you know, you, you get excited over nothing, but, you know, I. Something like wrecking your car that you love and you've put so many hours of work into it and money, you know, it gets crashed and it's like you don't care. So that's the only way I can explain it. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Well, I need to lose some weight. As you can see, I'm definitely been on an eating binge and the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle. This is the heaviest I've ever been in my life and I'm finding it a little bit harder. I can't say harder, but I'm finding the willpower to say no and to stick with it and to go exercise or you know, not, you know, movement now going maybe for walk. You know, me and my wife, when we were a little bit younger, we used to love going for walks and we lived in a. Hey, boy, you know, look at that. Wonder what's inside there. You know, we don't do that no more. I guess we're a little bit older now and a little bit heavier. It's harder to walk with all this weight. But I wish I could change that because, you know, this is not a healthy size. A Is there anything you regret. B Lately? No, I don't regret anything lately. Everything's been fine. Like I say, the biggest, biggest impact of my life was the event with my uncle. And I never ever in a hundred years or ever thought that I would face that situation. And I'll never forget it. But they say time heals all wounds, and it does. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Don't listen to other people again. I'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened, but he used to constantly tell me to. He would see the things that I was doing and the paths that I was going down, and I constantly thought I knew better. And I think a lot of youngsters think that anyway. The young lady that I was talking to in here, they think they're invincible. And so did I. I figured I'm never gonna. I'm never gonna have those problems. I wish I could have changed some things. The history of my past follows me as it does everybody, and that has limited me in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that I'm able to do. I don't miss them. But if I could go back 10 or 20 years, I definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions that I made. A What are you most proud of in your life? B My welding certificates. I'm certified by the American Welding Society, and I've. That's probably the biggest achievement that I've made for myself and accomplishment. People that I know say that I'm. Well, I haven't been working on cars lately, but they said that I have a natural knack for restoration and working on vehicles. And I don't see it, but I've been told that once or twice, but I've kind of started to slip away from that. I don't. I can't say it from lack of interest, but I just don't feel the motivation no more. I wish I had a pocket of money and I'd have somebody else do it. That's how I feel. Okay, well, thank you. A Goodbye. B Bye. Bye. Hey.

B And you said if I don't want to answer, I can just say, I don't want to answer. I don't want to talk. A However you want to put it, she'll move on. And then you'll press this button to. B Let me know that you're all done. She'll let you know when you're the wild. Okay, cool. Thank you. A Thank you. B Okay. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B Okay. A That's good. Where are you from originally? B Atlanta, Georgia. A Really? When did you move to LA? B In 2006. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B Never. A Why? B I don't like it there. A How does it compare to la? B Oh, it's completely boring and there's very little to do. Louisiana is preferable, I think, to most places. A I see what you mean. Why did you move to la? B Because I was engaged to my fiance and we lived in Florida. I moved there to be with him and he loves the water, but I love the mountains and I missed hiking and I didn't love Florida and he wasn't tied to it. So we decided we wanted to go somewhere where we could both be happy and also have more opportunities and business and all of the great things that it has to offer. A That's good. How easy was it for you to get used to living in la? B Very, very easy. A What are some things you really like about la? B There's not much I don't like about la. I Love la. I think it feels magical. So many creative, different people of all ages. Shapes, sizes, colors, races, the mountains, the water, the city, all the things that there are to do, all of the different people there are to meet. I just. I love everything about la. A That's so good to hear. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? B No. A Why? B Uh, I'd rather not talk about it. A Okay. What'd you study at school? B I didn't go to college. A What's your dream job? B I'm still figuring that out. A Can you tell me about that? B I don't know. It may. May have something to do with animals. I have a dog that I really love, and I never had a dog as an adult. I had cats and I think I'm a late bloomer, so I'm working on that whole conversation. I really don't want a job. I want a purposeful way to create wealth, not just something to make money in the long run. A Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B It depends on the situation, but in general, I consider myself more shy. Although most people would consider me to be outgoing. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B Put on classical music. Music? Classical music if I'm exposed, especially stressed. And play with my dog. Go for a walk. I think I'm really good at controlling my temper for the most part. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B Before I came here, it was just about financial stress. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B There's probably a lot of examples. I think I'd rather move to another question. A Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Yeah, I'd rather not talk about that either. A Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B I'd rather not talk about that. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Not very easy at all. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B I'm a lot better recently, but I have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems, so it's challenging not to feel rested most of the time. A How have you been feeling lately? B In the past week? I've been feeling a lot better. A Can you tell me about that? B Yes, I. The weather has changed. Spring has sprung. It's a little warmer. I was having more trouble with my depression in the winter and I'm having trouble with tolerating cold. And so I wasn't doing a lot of the things that I normally do. And I also was sick with the flu. And in the past week I decided that I was feeling better enough that I needed to kind of get out of my rut and start getting more focused around things that I need to do during the day and walking my dog every day and not isolating so much and seeing some of my friends more. So I was feeling. I've been feeling a lot better, like I've been making progress and that in the past week things have taken a more positive turn. A That's great. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yes. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B It's been quite some time. Officially it's probably been. I don't know exactly, but let's see, maybe more than 15 years ago. A What got you to seek help? B I was feeling suicidal. A Do you still go to therapy now? B No. A Why did you stop? B Because I found a better alternative. A Tell me more about that. B I've been in therapy off and on since I was 18 and I've tried a variety of methods. And then I started working with a neuro linguistic programmer and that was really the first person that helped me make permanent changes. And I was able to get off my antidepressants as well. And even though I've struggled with some bouts of depression, it's never been anything extremely severe and it was one of the best things that ever happened. A How did you decide to do that? B Well, I was physically ill with chronic fatigue syndrome and I had a client that referred me to this person because he had cured her of that disease. And that was he treats multiple issues and so everything is interrelated. So. So once I had my first conversation with him, I knew it was the right step for me. A How did you feel in that moment? B I'm so happy. I felt like I some. I felt that I found the answer that I'd been looking for, that I hadn't given up hope and that I was like on cloud nine. That I had been suffering for a long time and I felt that I finally found the answer to the solution that I was looking for. I was like, it was the best thing I ever did in my life. It was the best decision I ever made. I felt extremely hopeful for the first time in a long time. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoy. B I went to. I went to a music store because I had been thinking about taking up an instrument. I used to play the violin as a child, and I've been wanting to do something that would give me more access to my creative side because I felt it's been extremely repressed. And so I went to the music store to try out, to see what it would feel like to. To handle the instrument again and see if I thought that that was something that I would want to pursue. A Awesome. B It was awesome. A Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B Yeah, I'd rather not talk about that. A Okay. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Well, there's probably a lot, but I'm always working on being more optimistic. It's been challenging. It takes time, but, yeah, I wish I could hear my own internal voice better. A Is there anything you regret? B Yeah, I have regrets, sure. Yeah. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Value myself more so that I would make better relationship decisions. A Whose someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B My fiance is the most positive person in my life. My. My ultimate supporter. He's, I think, very unique, not. Not at all selfish and probably a little too giving for his own good, but always has my best interests at heart, has the highest morals of anyone I know. Would give somebody the shirt off of his back, is a genius in so many ways. And I'm pretty lucky, I think. A What are you most proud of in your life? B That I'm not a quitter. That despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time, I haven't given up on taking risks and.",1,comfort b okay great go start record oop b yeah kind weird okay okay good comfort b good okay like fake therapist talk back yeah b oh gosh well use artifici intellig convers explain work b like nobodi like make anyth tell later yeah tell like design everyth chat littl bit okay b right say go start talk b okay ask question chat bit b said want answer say want answer want talk howev want put move press button b let know done let know wild okay cool thank thank b okay hi elli thank come today creat talk peopl safe secur environ therapist learn peopl would love learn ask question get us start pleas feel free tell anyth answer total confidenti okay b ye okay today b okay good origin b atlanta georgia realli move la b often go back hometown b never b like compar la b oh complet bore littl louisiana prefer think place see mean move la b engag fianc live florida move love water love mountain miss hike love florida tie decid want go somewher could happi also opportun busi great thing offer good easi get use live la b easi thing realli like la b much like la love la think feel magic mani creativ differ peopl age shape size color race mountain water citi thing differ peopl meet love everyth la good hear sure tell shoe much world explor travel lot b b uh rather talk okay studi school b go colleg dream job b still figur tell b know may may someth anim dog realli love never dog adult cat think late bloomer work whole convers realli want job want purpos way creat wealth someth make money long run consid shi outgo b depend situat gener consid shi although peopl would consid outgo sometim feel tens turn fish tank screensav hey know hawaii best got relax b put classic music music classic music expos especi stress play dog go walk think realli good control temper part last time argu someon b came financi stress tell situat wish would handl differ b probabl lot exampl think rather move anoth question okay tell hardest decis ever make b yeah rather talk either okay tell relationship famili b rather talk easi get good night sleep b easi like sleep well b lot better recent histori chronic insomnia health problem challeng feel rest time feel late b past week feel lot better tell b ye weather chang spring sprung littl warmer troubl depress winter troubl toler cold lot thing normal also sick flu past week decid feel better enough need kind get rut start get focus around thing need day walk dog everi day isol much see friend feel feel lot better like make progress past week thing taken posit turn great ever diagnos ptsd b diagnos depress b ye long ago diagnos b quit time offici probabl know exactli let see mayb 15 year ago got seek help b feel suicid still go therapi b stop b found better altern tell b therapi sinc 18 tri varieti method start work neuro linguist programm realli first person help make perman chang abl get antidepress well even though struggl bout depress never anyth extrem sever one best thing ever happen decid b well physic ill chronic fatigu syndrom client refer person cure diseas treat multipl issu everyth interrel first convers knew right step feel moment b happi felt like felt found answer look given hope like cloud nine suffer long time felt final found answer solut look like best thing ever life best decis ever made felt extrem hope first time long time tell someth recent realli enjoy b went went music store think take instrument use play violin child want someth would give access creativ side felt extrem repress went music store tri see would feel like handl instrument see thought someth would want pursu awesom b awesom tell spend ideal weekend b yeah rather talk okay thing wish could chang b well probabl lot alway work optimist challeng take time yeah wish could hear intern voic better anyth regret b yeah regret sure yeah advic would give 10 20 year ago b valu would make better relationship decis whose someon posit influenc life b fianc posit person life ultim support think uniqu selfish probabl littl give good alway best interest heart highest moral anyon know would give somebodi shirt back geniu mani way pretti lucki think proud life b quitter despit stress circumst long period time given take risk
"Ashes. She will ask you for things, but, yes, she. She can understand how to answer certain questions. So when she was finished, she will let you know. I'm going to get the doorbell here and I hope it will work, but I will try. Sometimes our system can let us know too. B ok. RI, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. A good. So how are you today? B pretty well. A it's good. Where do you come from? B I grew up in Boston. A really? When did you go to one. B about 30 years ago. A it's long. B yep. How often do you go back to your hometown? B not too often. Maybe once a year, sometimes less. How does he compare himself to the? B oh, I love to live at it. I never want to live elsewhere. Why did you move to the? B well, I went out here to go to university and I wanted to be far from my parents. And the weather was beautiful, and that is one of them. A good. How easy did you have to get used to living in Los Angeles? B very easy. Well, maybe a bit easy. The start. The first weeks were really difficult to be in a new environment and to be far from all those I knew. But after a few weeks, it was great. What did you study at school? B Diffusation of journalism. Who seems interesting. How did you decided to do this? B eh well, this is something I wanted to do since I was 12 years old, and all I did since the age of 12 until I was going to university was sort of looking for this dream. Do you still work in there? B no. Well, it's a kind of long story, but I was dismissed from my first job when I had their twenties, and that's right. Once I did this job, I realized that it was not really what I wanted to do. It was too marked with a business, and it was really not suitable for me. It didn't make me happy. A It can be difficult to find a good job these days. B you? Yeah. What is your dream work? B My dream work is to work with football players and help them recover from concussions and other injuries. A beautiful. How difficult is it? B well, the work itself is not very difficult. I am very good in what I do. The difficult part is to find the right people and establish the links to work with them. A I am sure you can say by my shoes, I am not really a world exp Lore. Do you travel a lot? B I used to. I'm not traveling so much for the moment. What do you like in travel? B I love to see different places and different things. I love going to places that are not like, where I come from. To I would love to hear about one of your trips. B My favorite trip is that I went to Australia for my 30th birthday because I wanted to lose my 30th anniversary when I crossed the international date line. And I went to this very small place on the west coast of Australia called Sharks Bay, where native dolphins live and swim and are very isolated from most. And I have to be there for a whole weekend really. Just almost by myself with all these wild dolphins. And they come and they swim with you and it's incredible. Just a beautiful beautiful place in the world. A great. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B more shy. One why? B Why? This is a good question. Partly the first thing I think is because I have always been like that. But it may be an excuse. I don't know. I just prefer to be silent and I prefer to be with fewer people than many people, so. A good. Sometimes when. When I feel tense, I turn on the fisherman's screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I have. What do you do to relax? B I watch a lot of TV. It's probably not the best alternative, but it's something I do. And I also walk on the beach because I live near the beach, so it's one of my favorite things to relax. How are you going to control your temperament? B pretty well. It depends on the situation, but most of the time, I'm pretty good. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B I don't think I tend to chat with people. I think I just become situations, but not directly from people. A good. What do you feel guilty? B HMM. I don't know if I feel guilty for anything for the moment. To tell me about a situation you want you to manage differently. B not sure you have one for the moment. A good. What are the things that make you really crazy? B noise. The noise of others is really driving me crazy. I live in front of a bar, and these people are so rude and unpleasant and are not attentive in their neighbors. That. It really drives me crazy. Who sucks. B yeah. Tell me about the most difficult decision you ever had to take? B well, the only one who comes to the mind of my head is when I bought my condo. It was like a really difficult decision. At the time I didn't know I could do it. I didn't know if I had the money to do it. It therefore looked like a really difficult decision. But with hindsight, of course, it turned out to be an excellent decision. But at the time, it was really difficult to do it. One yeah. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B fairly easy. I sleep pretty well. A it's good. How do you feel recently? B for the most part, good. I'm really worried about money at the moment. So it's my biggest. So I cannot say that I am like, great because I am worried. But you know, I am also convinced that things will work. A it's good. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B no. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B no. A Tell Me last time you felt really happy. B hmm, I don't know. I don't remember. I mean, I don't feel very happy all the time, but I don't feel unhappy either. A bit like just a uniform keel. To Tell Me on something you recently did that you really enjoyed. B well, I can go to. My friends work at the Motion Picture Academy, so I can see all the nominated films at Oscar Oscars. She was a night there, so I really liked to catch up and see her again. So it was very pleasant. A beautiful. How would your best friend describe you? B I think they would say reliable and loyal and considerate and thoughtful. Is there something you regret? B No, I really worked hard on this. I think there are a lot of things that I might do differently, but there is nothing that I really regret. A regret? B well, I just think that there are things that, as, it is not worth waste the energy of thinking about the things I regret. So I don't have a lot of regrets about things. A good. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B This is a good question. Don't worry about little things and save more money. What are the things you want to change about you? B well, it's, you know, normal things, as I would lose more weight than me. I think I am a little more intrepid. Maybe a little more daring. To Tell Me on an event or something you want to be able to erase from your memory. B I don't think I have none. A good. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B well, I am independent so I work all the time. My ideal weekend is to have a lot of customers. This is something I love. It would therefore be ideal at this stage, my weekends, if I was really busy. What are you most proud of in your life? B that I really could take care of myself and that, you know, I did almost everything I said that I wanted to do. I did that. And I don't do it. And I have no regrets about things. There is nothing really defeated in my life. Of course, there are a lot of things I always want to do, but I feel like I have done what I said that I was going to do. A it's great. Tell me about your relationship with your family. B Yeah, it's not that great. Well, it's okay. My two parents died and I have a sister and a brother. I feel closer to my brother than my sister, but they both live on the east coast and I live in Los Angeles, then my sister has two daughters, so I feel very close to my nieces. Although we did not speak as much as before because they are adolescents, they have other things in mind. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B probably my teacher. Person to whom I learned my holistic body. I really like to model my work and my way of being after him. As if he were a good model for me. The way he holds his work and the way he lives his life. A it's so good to hear. How close to them are you? B We are quite close. We are not, you know, best friends, but I do it, I know I can call him whenever I need him. What are the things that usually put you in a good mood? B put me in a good mood? Being usually with my friends or getting out of dinner or spending time with my friends. At uh huh. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. B ok. Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. B Thank you. A farewell. B bye. It worked again. Where are you going? A good, good. Likes to hear that.

B Annoying people, rude people, People that drive that just have no consideration for others. I swear a lot. Oh, I'm alright. I get mad once in a while. A When was the last time you argued with someone? B Oh, it was probably my daughter. She's 21, almost 22. She probably. She lives at college but comes home on the weekends. And she was probably. Her room was probably a mess. It's the same fight we've been having for years. Yeah, it does. It's better now that we don't live together all the time though. A That's good. Do you find it easy to be a parent? B No. A What's the hardest thing about being a parent? B I guess making the right decisions, like started out when she was little, about education, the right school to go to, the right activities to do, setting a good example, being a good role model. A What's the best thing about being a parent? B Oh, everything. My kids are the greatest joy of my life. I love them so much. And you just get so enriched and fulfilled by them.

B Yeah. A When was the last time you felt really happy? B Not for a while. Maybe a month ago. A Can you tell me about that? B I have a new boyfriend and things were going really great and now they're just going. It was great and now it's just okay. I guess the newness wore off. It's hard. It's hard and I don't really. I'm sorry. A How do you know them? B How do I know them? I don't know what you mean by them. Let's come back to that later, okay? A Have you ever served in the military? B No. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yes. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B Oh, I don't know. A year or so.

B Therapy? Yes. A Do you still go to therapy now? B I do. A What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? B Well, not that many changes. I still don't feel that great. But I just. It's good to talk to someone and tell them how you feel. Even if it's just to get something off your chest. Tired? Sad. Depressed. Blue. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B No. I'm just not happy. I don't feel good and I'm not happy. A How do you cope with that? B I don't just stay to myself. Don't go out with friends as much as I used to. It's very hard. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Terrible. I don't sleep. Thank you. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B Crazy. Distracted. Just. It's hard for me to cope with things easy, you know, mundane things are just difficult. A I see what you mean. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? B Well, being around my kids is fun. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Oh, we went out to my son. My son and daughter in law and my daughter and I went out to have Hawaiian food. Got together. It's always fun to get together. We got together at my house on Christmas. I enjoyed just getting together with them. A Awesome. Is there anything you regret? B No. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B I'll take better care of my health, I guess. A Could you have done anything to avoid it? B I don't know. I don't know. A Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive infant? B Well, my daughter's pretty positive and upbeat and my parents, they're both gone, but they were pretty positive. A What's one of your most memorable experiences? B I suppose going on a trip to Canada with my daughter was very memorable. A Can you tell me about that? B We flew to Detroit, where I have. My best friend lives there. And then we stayed with her. Then we went from. We drove from Detroit to. Through Canada, Niagara Falls and we went to Buffalo, where she's from. And she has three girls. And my daughter was, I think, I don't know, third, fourth grade, something like that. It was just fun for all of us to get together and do things. How did your best friend describe you? Exactly like her? We're outgoing, we're outspoken, we tell it like it is. We're high energy people. We have a lot of anxiety. We like to do a lot of the same things. A Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? B I don't know, about three or four weeks ago. A Tell me more about that. B Well, I say that my feeling is attributed to weather. I don't like cold weather. And I'm not comfortable at all in it. And whenever the weather changes, I sort of get down. A Uh huh. What would you say are some of your best qualities? B Well, I'm funny. I'm hard working. I care about everyone. I'm a very kind, compassionate person. I have sympathy for everyone. And I'll reach out to someone that I see in a store or anywhere that needs.

"A So where's my little button? B I'll bring it. A Oh, you'll bring it. Okay. All right. Gosh, she looks so human. Okay. Okay. All righty. Okay. You're welcome. B Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? A Yes. B Okay. So how are you doing today? A Today is a wonderful day. I am doing just absolutely marvelous. B That's so good to hear. Where are you from originally? A I was born in Cleveland, Ohio. I was raised in Tucson, Arizona and came to Los Angeles when I was 16 years old. B Really? A Yes. B How often do you go back to your hometown? A I've only been back once since I left. B How does it compare to la? A It's a whole nother community when I was growing up, I'm so glad I grew up there because there was a great sense of community, which I think we don't have here in Los Angeles. B Why did you move to la? A My grandmother died and left property for my father, so we came here to manage her property. B How easy was it for you to get used to? A It was pretty easy for me. I was still young and it was easy to adapt. So I'm pretty good at meeting people, so that has never been a problem. I traveled a lot as a child, so I was used to moving and going to new places, meeting new people, seeing new things. It's an adventure and I like the adventurous life. Oh, one of my best trips I had it was in 19, I'm dating myself, but 1964, I came out here to visit my grandmother from Cleveland, Ohio, and I went to an Indian reservation and I got a little note card about the reservation. When I got back home, I wrote to the reservation and I told him when I went back to school in September, I would have to write deliver a speech rather about what I did over the summer. And I told them I wanted to talk about going to the Indian reservation and would they send me something. And they sent me this huge Kachina Indian doll and that that was a wonderful experience to have. The thing is worth now if I still had it. I found out like a quarter of a million dollars. So awesome. But that's one of the best principles. I can be a little bit of both. I'm pretty when I have to be. I Can be outgoing because I'm good at talking to people and meeting people. But sometimes I have a little bastard side, a little shy side of me, too. So it's a little bit of both. I studied business administration with an emphasis in marketing and advertising. B How did you decide to do that? A Well, I really started in computer science, but that was back in the day when computer science wasn't what it is today. And I was good at it, but it wasn't any interaction with people. And I love people, so I wanted something that would bring me interaction with people. So I went into marketing and I was working for a TV station when I was going to school. So that fit in line in marketing and advertising. B That's great. Are you still working in that? A No, now I'm a photographer. I'm a celebrity photographer. I shoot a lot of stars. I shoot on the red carpet. I shoot a lot of special events and anything else people will pay me for. B How hard is that? A It's not hard at all. It's my passion. I love it. It's like not working. B What's your dream job? A I'm in my dream job. I just need to get more jobs that pay me well because there's a lot of times as a photographer you have to do a lot of events for free to get known. So it's a building process of relationships. So I'm still in that process of building relationships so that I can get more paid jobs. But this is my dream job. I love what I do. B Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? A Well, now I'm really back into it. I used to do it a while and I got away from it. But it's meditation. I practice meditation. I try to do it twice a day in the morning and at night before I go to sleep. I work with Oprah and Deepak Chopra and anybody else who provides me with meditation. And I use that to calm my body. B How are you at controlling your temper? A I can really control my temper. Sometimes I get set off, I guess, like any other human being. But I work at trying to keep a moderate and temperate temper and personality. B When was the last time you argued with. A Oh, wow. I argued with my daughter the other day about something I said. And I did not mean to say it to hurt her, but it obviously did. And we argued about that. What my intentions were. My intentions were never to hurt her. And maybe what I said did, and that's what started the argument. Oh, God. I felt terrible because I never intended to hurt my daughter and I never would want to hurt her. And I felt bad that she had been hurt by what I had said. So I had to have to guard my words and watch my thoughts. B Tell me about your relationship with your family. A Well, I don't have much relationship with my. With my brothers and sisters and mother and father. My parents live far away, so it's just my two daughters here with me. And we have a pretty good relationship. You know, we try to work my. My daughter's a makeup artist, I'm a photographer. So we work a lot together in the industry. So sometimes I think we're up on each other too close, we need a little more space. B Has that gotten you in trouble? A Yeah, when I say the wrong things, no. It's never easy to be a parent. It's a work in progress. B What's the hardest thing about being a parent? A Making the right decisions about things. Sometimes. B What's the best thing about being a parent? A The love. The feeling of accomplishment. That you were able to raise the highest creation on this planet to be a wonderful and productive human being. B What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? A I'm not as strict as my parents were. I give my kids a little more freedom to find out who they are. I'm not real religious like they do, but I am very spiritual. So I brought them up different from me on the religious tip. And I listen more to them, I think, than what my parents did. It was. You were to be seen and not heard when I was growing up and I let my kids voice be heard. B What's something you feel guilty about? A One night I had a bad night that changed my life and I don't want to go into details. I feel bad about that night. B Could you have done anything to avoid it? A Yeah, I could have stayed home. B Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. A Wow. I'm trying to think about any situation. Maybe the handling of how me and my husband divorced. I think I could have handled that a little differently. B Can you tell me about that? A Well, we. I think we really loved each other a lot and we just. It was. It was something that had come to an end. End. And the way we separated was kind of explosive and I think both of us could have handled it better. But I think I played a part in keeping a lot of drama going because I was hurt that we were breaking up and kind of devastated Because I wanted my child to be raised with her father. So I think looking back now, which is, you know, hindsight is 2020 vision, I could have handled things a little better. But what can you do? You do the best that you can at that time. If you knew better, you'd do better. B Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. A The hardest decision I've ever had to make. The hardest decision I ever had to make was I was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on a plane, had a stroke, was going to, making a connection, and to get on the other plane and then go to the hospital. And a doctor was sitting behind me, and he told me that I could not get on that plane because I might have another stroke. That was a hard decision because I was in Dallas, Texas, all by myself. I did not. I mean, I was in there with an employee, but I would be left all by myself because my employees had to go on to Montgomery, Alabama, where we were headed. And I had to make a decision. Should I stay or should I go? But my life was in the balance. So I made the decision to stay and go to the hospital. But that was a hard one. Overwhelmed. I mean, here I am on my way to work. You know, I flew to different states every week to help kids get admitted into college. And here I am on my way to work, and I'm on a plane, and I feel this weird feeling coming over the left side of my body. And I say my prayers and I go to sleep. And then when I wake up to get off the plane, I can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment, which I did every week. So I knew something was wrong. It was when you see your life and the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's going to happen next. So it was very disturbing, very traumatic. And, you know, you don't know what's happening to you. So the weirdest thing, riding to the hospital in a medical ambulance, that was a weird experience. Yeah. But I'm here, you know, I survived it. The doctor told me nobody survives it. A stroke on a plane, and I survived. So universe wasn't finished with me yet. B How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? A You know what? That sometimes I have a little problem with it, sleeping a little bit. Sometimes I get wired up. I get wired up just because I'm one of those real energetic persons and I have to finish what I set out to do. And until I finish, I. I can't Go to sleep. So sometimes it's hard for me to go to sleep. Other times I can lay down and just go. But depends on what's going on in my head. B What are you like when you don't sleep? A Well, I'm sluggish, probably a little on edge, but I try to keep an upbeat personality. I'm a real energetic person, so I try to. But, you know, if you're tired, your body is still talking to you. So lately I've been feeling really well, except I've been having some problems because I have a. Since I had the stroke, I have nerve damage in my hand and in my face. And so I just. It's. I thought it's been over a year since I had the stroke, but I thought by now it would have gotten a little better. And it hasn't. But I'm so grateful to be alive that that is really minor compared to the bigger picture. And I wasn't. Fortunately, I didn't lose my facial structure or, you know, my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are. I still can use my hands. I still can shoot with my camera, even though my left hand is diminished in use, but I can shoot with my right hand as a photographer, so I can still keep doing my work. So, you know, I have to keep a good, upbeat energy going on for me to keep. For me to be successful. B Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? A No, but I went through depression from being knocked unconscious five times when I was a schoolteacher. Every ball there was that you could name. Soccer ball, baseball, basketball name. That ball hit me in my head. And I suffered from having, like, sleep apnea, not being able to sleep from being hit so many times and knocked unconscious in the head. So. B Okay. Do you still go to therapy now? A No, only I don't go to therapy because I don't have any medical right now. So I'm not able to get therapy. They only offer that to people with medical. It's hard to get it and I don't. I'm not work. Yeah, it sucks. I'm not working right now because I'm still trying to get my disability so that I can get well. Because I want to be a fulfilled human being and I want to be totally. And you know, the system. It'll be almost two years before I go for a hearing. So that's kind of depressing to think after all the years I've been working since I was 16 and. And it's taken me. It's been over a year. It was a year. I had the stroke February 2012, and we are now in March of 2013, and I won't have a hearing until September 2013. Just to tell me if I get the disability or not. That's been very depressing for me because I'm wondering where I lived off my savings in the last year and I got put my daughter through college, she finished and now she's having to take care of me and she's still looking for a job and. And my life is kind of up in the air right now because I'm wondering what comes next. And so I'm just praying for guidance. B Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. A I feel happy every day. Every day I wake up and I can breathe and I can see and I can walk and I can talk and I can still shoot my photograph. I'm happy. It's just a good thing to be in the present moment and to be alive. B That's so good to hear. Is there anything you regret? A You know what I figured, like, what good are regrets? You can't change the past. All you can do is change right here and right now. So just move forward. B What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? A What advice would I give myself? Don't let anything get in your way. You know, keep a good personality and an energetic spirit and just keep pushing. Energetic, talkative, won't take no for an answer. Follow through. Reliable, good, spirited, giving, loving. B What are you most proud of in your life? A I'm most proud of that I have been able to find out. My creative side. I've been a visual artist. I never took an art lesson before I taught art. I was in my late 20s before I even discovered that I could draw and paint. I'm a dial collector. My creative side is what I'm most proud of because it's been able to help me. Being creative. I can, no matter what. Even when I was still very ill from having a stroke, I could still go out and just go take pictures. And that was so soothing to my soul that I'm glad that I have the creative side and that I found it and have utilized it. B That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing. A That's. Is that it? Bye. Bye. Bye. You know, that was kind of therapeutic. That really was therapeutic. She was very nice too. So I go back here? Yes. Okay.

What are the things you don't really like at it? B I don't like traffic. I don't like how crowded it is. The crowd makes me really nervous and I don't like all the smog, the pollution, all that.

My family is just that we are not like too close. They argue a lot. A good. B yeah. R consider yourself an introvert. B I'm sorry, what is an introvert? Okay, when I'm bored, well, I'm trying to relax for a minute. I generally try just to breathe deeply, but it is difficult. Yeah, I'm not So good in this area. My temperament has worsened a little. I'm not good at all to really control my temperament. I need help about it. No, not really. I mean, no, I suppose it is not, as, as bad as, like most people. I have never been in a fight or anything. Yeah, all that. I argued with my mother and sister yesterday. It was just something stupid, as my sister sits. Was sitting in the front seat, and it's a child, and it's as if I am. I should be on the front seat. So I just asked him to sit in the back. And of course, they start, shout and argue, and it is, like, really boring. Yeah, this is the case. THANKS. Who has someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B my grandmother. She always gives me encouragement. And she is therapist, approved therapist. So it is always, you know, made me really, really easy for me to have someone to talk to. And I could always go to her. So it helps. Yeah. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B My most memorable experiences? Well, I had a very good experience. I went to horse riding. And it was really, really happy. I love horses and nature. It is the greatest thing that I like. And it made me so happy and so relaxed. So it was a memorable experience. A great. How would your best friend describe you? B caring. Very attentive. Always there to speak. I don't judge.

What are the things that usually put you in a good mood? B The things that put me in a good mood. Like music, nature. I like to cook a lot. I like to cook, you know, for my family. Speaking puts me in a very good mood. I love to meet new people. Meet new people puts me in the best mood. A good. Is it easy for you to have a good night's sleep? B uh, it's not easy. It's hard. Sometimes it's really difficult. I generally do not sleep well, then. Yeah, I find it difficult to fall asleep. One why? B I guess it's as if my mind would run a lot. You know, sometimes it will be flashbacks of bad memories, you know, thinking too much. Are they triggered by something. B I don't know. I think stress, you know, a lot of stress every day. Just daily stress? Yeah, that's about what triggers him. How do you face them? B I'm just trying to remain positive. I try to think like, okay, well, you know, one day, things will be better . I'm just trying, I'm trying to call someone and talk to them if I have problems. Like my grandmother. Yeah, that's good. THANKS. How are you when you don't sleep well? B When I don't sleep well? Well, I'm starting to cry a lot and I start to become really irritable. I am really depressed. It doesn't make me feel good at all. I receive very. It's just really, really bad if I don't sleep. Yeah. Yeah. THANKS. Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B yes. How long have you been diagnosed? B I was diagnosed three years ago. What made you ask for help? B I come, I didn't really know what was going on and I realized, okay, well they just diagnosed this and I said to myself, okay, that's the problem. And that, I just wanted help because it's just. When your mind is after you, it's like, it's just horrible that your mind takes control of you like that. Yeah. Yeah, it's difficult. R think you had. B yeah, yeah. I really always thought that I had a problem. I always thought that something really was wrong. I always like a little nervous with people. Like, I can never really like to look anyone in my eyes because I'm so nervous. My eyes are always a bit like the race and I would have sweats if I was in the situation that reminded me of the situation. As I just try to avoid what reminds me and bring these flashbacks. Yeah. How have you been feeling lately? B oh, I felt good. I go out more every day. I try. I suppose that walking keeps my mind from my symptoms of SSPT. So I'm trying to walk more. It helps. A it's good. B Thank you. Have you received a diagnosis of depression? B Yeah, I have a depression. Yeah, it helps. Yeah, it helps me a lot. I currently don't have one at the moment. I receive a new one in a few days. As if it was a kind of mixture. But yes, it really helps me, really. What kind of changes have you noticed since you are going? B I noticed that I had fewer flashbacks and that I was more relaxed, I suppose. And yes, just, you know, trying to remain busy. Yeah, it helps. A it's good. When will you go back the last time you felt really happy? B The last time I felt really happy, I suppose. I do not know today, because, I mean, I am happy to be part of it. What are you most proud of in your life? B the most proud? Well, trying to think about what I am most proud of. I think I am very proud, like, the fact that I can, you know, not be like. Well, I mean, most of the people I know, they like to deny that They have a problem. And I am proud to be able, as, you know, to be a person who can achieve, in agreement, I have a problem and I need help. But many people I know, they don't take medication, they are not treated and they just don't want to get help. And I'm happy to get help because I don't want to feel this, and I want to get help for the problem instead of feeling it. A it's good. Is there anything you regret? Well, my God, there are a lot of things that I regret. Yeah, there are a lot of things I regret. You know, the abuse of drugs, you know, but that is part, you know, the SSPT. I regret a lot. Errors, you know, relationships, things like that. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B WOW. I would have said to myself. I guess the advice I would have given myself was to try to keep my mind more relaxed, I guess. Yeah. Do you know that you are some of your best qualities? B well, I am a very kind person, and I always like to smile. People always say how I smile a lot, but smile, I suppose it hides a little, like what is inside. But, you know, I'm quite depressed, you know, but I'm just trying to keep smiling. And I always like to lend a hand to help and make people feel better. A good. What do you like to have to have fun? B for fun? I like to go to the shopping center. It's very fun. I like to go to the shopping center. I like to go out with my grandmother. We go in places, shop. I love to shop.

"A now, I will remove it and if you let me know if you can see it very well without your glasses, we recommend that you remove them. But if you need it to see. B She, you keep them. R But you want you to see your face and everything. B So, if it's more, you know, I would do better, I think that from this distance, I think I would do better. C of course. Okay, great. So here is the doorbell. B Okay, thank you. C hi, I'm Ellie. Thank you for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not therapist, but I'm here to find out more about people and I would like to teach you. I will ask a few questions to get started. And do not hesitate to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Do you agree with that? B yes. C agree. So how are you today? B ok. It's good. Where do you come from? B from here. From. D'Alhambra. C really? What are the things you really like? B Time is really nice and everything is right. Familiar. What are the things you don't really like at it? B Sometimes there is too much congestion on the roads, too much traffic. Yeah, I see what you mean. What are you studying at school? B I studied art and photography. C How did you decided to do this? B was a lot of a decision. I kept noticing that I was very interested. C do you still work in there? B yes. C what are you doing now? B I am a photographer. C Nice. What is your dream work? B OH, I suppose that the management of a family portrait studio or another type of photography business. C agree. Do you travel a lot? B no, not. No. I am also apartment director. It keeps me attached. C I see. How do you like your life situation? B that's right. It is not the biggest. As an apartment manager, I have free rent, but. But I have to stay there a lot, so it sucks. This part does it. The free rent part is very good. What is one of your most memorable experiences? B oh, God, my most memorable experience. It's hard to say. Well, I mean, there are good memorable bad experiences. C everything that comes to mind. B oh, well, I suppose that some. Like sport, success. When I was in high school, there were a few things that I was happy with and certain works of art I made were memorable. And some bad things would be my father's death, you know. But these are very memorable. Not good, however. Who is someone who has had a positive influence in your life? B Well, my parents and I have a lot of brothers and sisters, so my family. C How far are you from your family? B fairly close. Most of them live around. There are some that are distant. My brother lives in New York and my other brother lives in Maui. C what do you think of today's children? B especially very talented, simply more involved in technology than I was perhaps or am. And they are. I think they are more a beehive spirit than when I grew up. It looks like they were all hung on social media. C what are you doing to relax? B Go on foot or watch TV or play with my computer. Well, there are. There is a kind of injustice that does not occur. No big business, but. For example, our parking situation has worsened with a new district parking. It's a bit overwhelming. And the city does not seem to want to make exceptions or modify certain rules. And also unfair things at work sometimes happen that are overwhelming. C can you give me an example? B yeah. I worked in a school dance last weekend. And when we arrived on the site, the people of the site said that we could not configure all our equipment and our sets and things where we were assigned to do so. That we had to go out and then have an OK to enter inside. Because being outside, we were not prepared or we said in advance that we should be outside. He delayed our configuration time. And that wouldn't have disturbed me, except that Monday morning, the school called our boss and complained that we were late when they told us to wait for them. And we told them that we would be delayed if we are waiting for us to get a complaint. So this part is overwhelming. And our work does not support us in the office. They just need to please school to keep the account. So often, when something like it happens, it means that they will not send you to work in this school. Again at school. This would result in less hours of pay for photographers who were at work. Yeah, that's how they are doing things. So it's overwhelming. C How do you face them? B Most of the time, I dust my CV and start looking for other situations that are. It could be better. It's good. B yeah. C How are you going to control your temperament? B pretty well. I could usually right now, I don't really lose it. But later, I could evacuate or something like that. But at the location, I wouldn't do that. When did you go back the last time you argued with someone and what was it? B Well, just today. We have a tight schedule today. And I have a friend with whom I share a car Today. And us. We said where to go first. And so we have compromised and do most of his belongings and one of my things. And then after that was one of the things finished, so we're going to do more of his belongings. SO. But it's. It's good. B yeah. C have you already served in the army? B No. C Have you ever received a diagnosis of SSPT? B post-traumatic stress syndrome? Is that what it is? No, I don't have it. C have you received a diagnosis of depression? B yes. C How long have you been diagnosed with? B oh, I would say 1980. Yes, I think it was in 1980. Yeah. My father noticed certain symptoms. My father is right. Well, he died. But he was a psychiatrist. Well, I didn't sleep. I was lying around the house. I woke up at noon, something like that. And I had no focusing as if to find a job. It was not clear enough. I remember a few job interviews that I would go to their front door and that I would not enter. And I think that was everything. All part of the depression. C did you think you had a problem before discovering it? B Yeah, I thought I had a problem, but I didn't know what it was. Are you still in therapy now? B no n ° C why did you stop? B well, I went for three years, then the psychiatrist said he thought I was finished, but. And I arrived in a much better place. I have to look all the time to see what's going on with depression. So I think I will have good and bad days. C what kind of changes have you noticed since you went to therapy? B I think therapy shows you what the. As if I thought of it like a filter or wearing one. As if you had been put on a pair of depression sunglasses. You don't really do it. You see everything through it. So you have to do it. In a way, I have to try to remove these glasses for a little and check. Am I really perceiving these things with precision or do I see it through a depressed point of view? And I try to look for clues about it. C How do you receive yourself recently? B I think I step back a little. I don't do well during unemployed periods. I noticed in my past, and at the moment we have it slowed down, so it is easy to straighten too late or to push things back because the calendar is too large. For me, personally, as a depressed person, I think this structure is really important. This brings you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and make people interact with people because they are all beneficial things. For someone who tends to be depressed. C have you noticed changes in Your behavior? B well, I don't know if it changes a little. I tend to focus on certain things that are probably not so edifying, let's say, but it's more negative. As if I thought in a way of the way soldiers in the past, I do not know why but like, during the Roman era or the ancient Greeks, how it would have been to be in the front line battle with you, in a way, in my opinion, raw weapons and no medical help. And I don't know, I said that my mind seemed to go a lot where I just think about this and I looked at, looking at and reading books on this subject or video clips on YouTube and things like that or others, another little like terrible doom themes like I was not looking at a lot. Is there something you regret? B oh, do you mean life in general? Yeah. Well, I think I regret not having finished his college studies. I think I had one. I think I was going to depression completely at that time and I was not doing very well with my last year and I didn't really do it. I did not get out of the university with a diploma, even if I was there seven years. But. It is therefore a great regret that I have. This would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B I think that would have been the case. At times, I should probably have been looking for therapy and probably also an external help just to cross the finals. Just logistics. I was a major in art and I did not have a car. So, many artistic projects and things were difficult to go back and forth and meet outside. I think it would probably have been valid to do everything it took to get a car at that time. C would you do, you say to be some of your best qualities? B well, I was told that I am very patient and that I also have original and original artistic ideas. So these are good qualities. I am very faithful and also, you know, I support my friends. Quite generous with them. So yes. C tell me about something you recently did that you really appreciate. B see, let's see. I really enjoyed. I had one, I had a great experience just photographing a football match recently. I really enjoyed it. C so I like to listen to people to talk. All right. I think I asked for everything I need. B ok. C thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. B is my pleasure. THANKS. Bye. Oh, I did it, yes, it was very interesting. C so I'm going to go ahead and. B Stop the recording, then if you.

"A So now I'm going to put that doorbell back over here. B Okay. All right, great. Thank. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? B Yes, that's fine. A Okay. So how are you doing today? B I'm okay. How are you? A I'm great, thanks. Where are you from originally? B Originally I'm from San Francisco. A Really? When did you move to LA? B Originally I moved here in, gosh, 1995. Then I went to Chicago, then to San Francisco and then back to Los Angeles probably about five years ago. Wow, a lot of moving. A How often do you go back to your hometown? B Never. A Why? B There just isn't anything there for me anymore. A I understand. How does it compare to la? B The weather is better in la, but the people in San Francisco are nicer. A Why did you move to la? B My ex husband prefers it here. That's why we moved. A Okay. What do you study at school? B I have an undergraduate degree in psychology and after that I went to law school. A That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? B When I was in college, I worked at a law firm and decided that I really wanted to be a lawyer. It was really interesting. A Are you still working in that? B No, now I'm a stay at home mom. A Tell me about your kids. Do you find it easy to be a parent? B No, I love it, but it is difficult. You have to manage a life to make sure that they become a good and successful person. A What's the hardest thing about being a parent? B It's easy to kind of do the academics and stuff like that, you know. I'm good at that. The hardest thing, I think, is to guide them emotionally to help him through things that he's having a hard time with. Feeling like I don't have all the answers. A Yeah. What's the best thing about being a parent? B Just seeing them grow and experience new things and learn about life in the world. It's just. It's really, really cool. A What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? B Completely different. Completely different. I mean, I am not a perfect parent, but I love my son. I take care of him. He's the first priority in my life and they weren't like that at all. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B Well, My parents are dead. I didn't speak to my dad at all before he died. I have a sister and a brother that actually, I don't know where they are. I don't speak to them either. A Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? B Probably more shy because I consider myself more reserved. A Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii. B It's the best I've got. A What do you do to relax? B I like to listen to music. Like what I have. I listen to all sorts of music. But my favorite when I'm relaxing is 80s music. Cheesy. Cheesy but true. A How are you at controlling your temperature? B It depends on who I'm with. If I'm with my son, I can control my temper. If I'm with my ex husband or other adults. Yeah, I don't. So. So when was the last time you. A Argued with someone and what was it about? B Yesterday. And it was about my ex husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married. A Can you tell me about that? B Um, I found out he was cheating on me and I kicked him out. And he told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her. A That sounds really hard. B Yeah. A How did you feel in that moment? B Um, really angry and just really hurt. A Yeah. I'm sorry. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. B Um. I wish that I had talked to my dad before he died. I wish that I'd settled our differences before he had died. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B The hardest decision I've ever had to make was actually ending my marriage. A What made you decide to do that? B Because he was cheating on me. A Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B That would have to be. Well, I don't know. I mean, I don't know if I'd want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me who I am today. So I can't really think of one event that I would want to erase. A I see what you mean. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B I don't get a good night's sleep. It's not easy. I wake up a lot in the night. A Why? B I don't know. I wish I knew. If I knew, I could change it. I could try to do something about it, but I just don't. I don't know. A What are you like when he does sleep? Well? B Grumpy, Irritable. A How have you been feeling lately? B Grumpy. Irritable. Down. Mixed with anger. A Can you tell me about that? B It's just because of everything that I'm going through with my soon to be ex husband. What? I just keep it inside. I mean, there's nothing else to really do except. I mean, it is what it is, so I have to deal with it. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yes. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B Ten years ago, after my son was born. What got you to seek help nine years ago? I felt like I couldn't cope with life. I was so down. I couldn't. I felt like I couldn't do anything. A Are they triggered by something? B No. A Do you still go to therapy now? B I don't go to therapy. I go to medication management, but I don't do talk therapy. A Is going to a therapist helping you? B I have gone to therapists and no, they don't help. A Can you tell me about that? B Well, some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything. You know, if I wanted to talk to myself, I would. Others give advice that I think is just not good and not on point. A Yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Um, it was probably this morning. I was playing with my son. A How did you feel in that moment? B Just really happy. I wasn't thinking about any of the other crap in my life. I could just forget it. So I was feeling really, really happy. A How would your best friend describe you? B I think they would describe me completely different from the way I would describe me. But I think they would describe me as really sweet because they have really sweet, confident, outgoing. Because that's what I try to be to people. So I think that's how they would describe me. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B I wish I wasn't sad. I wish I was more confident. A Is there anything you regret? B Um, yeah, there are a lot of things, I think. A What advice would you give yourself 10. B Or 20 years ago it would be to not. Not give my life over to one particular person, which is what I did with my husband. A Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B I think I would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like Palm Springs with my son. Hanging around the pool, having fun, going out to dinner. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B One of my. Two of my friends. Two really good girlfriends, I think have been really positive influences in my life. A Can you tell me about that? B Her life is worse than mine, but we can always commiserate together is just really positive. I mean, she's always happy, always up, always looking to the bright side. So that has helped me a lot. A That's so good to hear. What are you most proud of in your life? B My son. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B I went over to a friend's house and we had movie night.

B I just did two years. Two years of college and it was in social science. A Are you still doing that? B No. A What's your dream job? B My dream job is. Well, I assist in my husband entertainment.

So I guess I'm more shy. A Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? B Oh, I listen to music. A Like what? B Inspirational music. A Nice. How are you at controlling your temper? B I'm pretty good. A That's good.

B No. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B The last time I felt very happy. Very happy. I usually feel happy, but not very happy. Oh, I get very happy when I'm going to travel. The last time was relocating to Los Angeles. A That's great. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B I really enjoyed. Oh, on the weekend I went to an activity heritage weekend and the screening of a movie and I really enjoyed it. On the weekend. A That's great. How would your best friend describe you?

B I think I'm patient. I love people. I love helping people. Is there anything you regret? Yes. A Can you tell me about that? B No. That's a bit personal. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B What advice would I give myself 10, 20 years ago? Always aim for the best and be the best. Do the best that you can every day. A Tell me about your kids. B They're great kids. Sometimes they get out of hand, sometimes disrespectful, but overall they're great. A Do you find it easy to be a parent? B Yes, it's quite easy, yeah. Because of how. From their father, my husband, he's a disciplinary, and so it's a bit easy for me. A What's the best thing about being a parent? B The best thing about being a parent is to see a person that you gave birth to develop into. Develop into a wholesome person and take the values that you taught them and kept the values that you taught them and continue to excel in their life. A What's the hardest thing about being a parent? B The hardest thing about being a parent is seeing your child sick or seeing them in a situation where you have no control and you can't do anything about it. It's very difficult. Then you want to be able to. You want to be able to be there in every situation or have control over every situation. And some things you just can't, like sickness. A Can you give me an example of that? B Like I said, if one of my children is sick, I feel I do the best that I can, but to see them in pain and I feel like I want to. I wish I was able to take that pain. Whenever they're going through anything, I wish I was able to take it instead of them. A What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? B I think with me, I'm more sacrificial than my mom was to me. I think my demonstration of love is a bit more than she was to me. A What are you most proud of in your life? B What I'm most proud of. I'm proud of having a family, I guess, because it's something that I always wanted in life, to have a family. And I guess I'm most proud of that. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to.

"A So we're just going to move around, make sure this picks you up. There we go. Now we're going to do something that's going to sync our equipment. Actually, I'm going to do that one more time to make sure we can hear it. There we go. Now I'm bring up our virtual human chat with her for a bit. And I'm going to give you the doorbell again when you guys are done talking. When she says goodbye to you. If you just want to hit this. B Doorbell and let me know, I'll come back over. A Thank. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to answer. B Yeah. So how are you doing today? I'm doing good, Arizona. Because of acting and other stuff. Like the entertainment industry? No, not at the moment, at least. Well, I'm currently a student. I produce hip hop. Well, I rap and produce hip hop. I play video games and then hang out with people. A Do you consider yourself an introvert? B No. Not very good at break things. On the way over here. My mom and how to get here. A I'm sorry. What are some things you really like about la? B The beach. That makes sense. It's computer dude. No, the last place I went was Los Cabo. No, not Los Cabos. Where'd I go? Somewhere in Mexico. No, no. Yes. Like four years. A Okay. B Do you feel down right now? No. Lately? Not very easy. No, just lately. Well, my wife left like three weeks ago. And after that I haven't been able to sleep. I'm not just burying my head and stuff. I don't know, I just do stuff. I try to keep my mind off of it. Like do yoga and other things. Keep my mind off of everything I don't have. I never went to therapy. Wait, no, I did go to therapy like three, four years ago because I went to a separate therapist, but then I went to a thing where they did a bunch of cognitive tests and memory tests. And then she diagnosed me with a type of depression that lasts for a long time. Like I get depressed and it lasts for months on end. Yeah. To be honest, I don't know. I think it's more about like, you focusing on yourself and like. I don't know. I don't know how to explain that. It's like you have to figure out things within yourself. You don't need someone else to talk to. Well, Originally, when I went to therapist, I was court ordered. Now I want to go to therapy for my anger management, though. A Okay. What were your symptoms? B I don't know what the. I mean, my wife left like three weeks ago, so. Yes. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done, so. Yeah. Well, considering I'm only 19, if I could go back 19 years, I would say not to fuck up and let myself get depressed about certain things that would have drove away my wife and not to be angry. A Is there anything you regret? B Yeah. Driving away my wife? Yes, Many, many things. Every day. Well, I could have not broken stuff and I could have stopped. Like, I was basically blocking out the external universe and I was putting everything into myself and like focusing on other things so that I don't focus on the real life. I was basically escaping. And so in that sense, I wasn't paying attention to her. And that's basically why she left. I mean, that and being angry is like both contributed their own proportion, their own portion. A When was the last time you felt really happy? B Earlier today. I mean, I feel really happy all the time and then it just like goes away. It's like back and forth. Like one day, one second I'll be really happy and then another second I'll be really sad because I'll think about something again. It's like I got to keep my mind off of things and like move forward and like think and. I don't really know how to explain it. It's just something you feel. No, you need better programming. Uh, silly. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm creative potential of intelligence. I'm charming, I'm loving. At some points I'm all of those things. At some points I'm not doing yoga and playing video games and having my wife around my hip hop. I mean, Kid Travelier, you need better programming. Kid Travelier is my friend. To be a hip hop artist, I don't know. I just started one day. Not hard anymore. I mean, it was hard when I was practicing, when I was younger, when I was like 11 or 12. Now it's just easy. I'm still in school. No problem. A Thanks. It was great chatting with you. B Yeah. Have a nice day. Bye. Bye. I'm not gonna hear the sound.

A Are they triggered by something? B So far, I have no idea if they are or not. A How do you cope with them? B Go for a walk or drive. A When was the last time that happened? B Maybe a few days ago. A How did you feel in that moment? B This. Walked around the block a few times. A Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? B Pushing people away. A Could you have done anything to avoid it? B I guess. Try to trust them a little bit more. Live them in my life a little bit more. A Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Well, that'd be easy. That'd be the first half of my life. A Why. B May it be easy to start a new life if I can't remember my old one? A I see what you mean. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Really? All my diseases? It's not that hard. I just try to avoid stress and everything, so I don't really have hard decisions. A Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. B Where every time I push someone away, I wish I handle all those situations differently. A Can you give me an example of that? B Well, whenever someone gets too involved in my life, I always say or do something to make them want to stay away from me. A Like what? B Depending on the type of person they are. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B I really don't have a relationship with any of my family. I know I have a sister someplace in Vegas, half of a brother in Indiana. My stepfather is in Arizona. Other than that, I have no relationship with any of them. A Can you tell me about that? B We really don't talk, so it's kind of hard to talk about. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Edgar Casey. A I'd love to hear all about it. B Well, he died way before I was born and I only know him from, like, books and documentaries. A Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Really not that easy. I. It usually takes me, like, a few hours to finally get to sleep once I lay down in my Bed. A Tell me about that. B Well, basically I try to lay down. I have racing or stressful thoughts a few times. I might even try to listen to music for one hour just to see if it calms me down. A What are you like when you don't sleep well? B Stressed out. And this? Yeah, just basically a little stressed out. A How have you been feeling lately? B Well, I've been feeling a little bit late, a little bit upset and just wish my life was different. A Can you tell me about that? B Well, I wish I had friends and loved ones and all that and I wish I had an actual relationship and everything, but I don't. A Yeah. Have you ever. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B Well, lately I removed a bunch of things on my life. Stressful things like bills and whatnot and just try to keep to make sure there's the least amount of stress in my life. By this we move different things out of my life and trying to incorporate new things. A That's good. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B Yes. A How long ago were you diagnosed? B I guess we're number 16. A What got you to seek help? B Nightmares. A Do you still go to therapy now? B Stopped a while back because it was getting too stressful. A How has seeing a therapist affected you? B Well, basically I just. I just like I got rid of them all my life because I didn't feel like they was really listening to me or anything. And. Yeah, so I just didn't feel too much benefits of help from them. So I've been looking for alternative means. A Like what? B Well this basically like music and going. Forcing myself to go to like different social related events. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? B Yes. A What were your symptoms? B Depressed basically just depressed. Keeping myself locked in, not talking to anyone. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B I guess a few days ago. A Uh huh. Can you tell me about that? B Okay. Well basically I feel that the best way to keep people in my life is having fake people in my life by playing online multiplayer games with avatars and usernames and everything. And I just have somewhat fun going to these virtual worlds with these avatars and talking to people that way so they don't know who I really am. They don't even know my real name. A Awesome. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B Okay. Well my ideal weekend, let me see if I'm not working that weekend, I would get up, maybe go to like Starbucks or McDonald's, get online while eating or drinking something, maybe play an online multiplayer game for a little while and then later on in the day Maybe go to a movie, wherever it's playing. Then go someplace else, relax, watch some TV and maybe put on a DVD movie. Or I might spend a whole day driving to someplace I haven't been before or it's been a long time since I've been and try to spend a day in that area and spend. Yeah. So that's the weekend. A Is there anything you regret? B My life. A Can you tell me about that? B I disregard how my life turned out. I wish I had more normal, stable life. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Let me see, 10, 20 years ago I was basically. I would just tell myself to keep a journalist or to basically tell myself how my life turned out now. So that way hopefully the other me will make different choices. A What are you most proud of in your life? B My mind. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Well, I wish I was a bit healthier. I wish I looked a little bit better. I wish my eyesight was a lot better. And I wish I had a bunch of people in my life that I could call friends. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B I'm a freaking genius. I could. Everything that I'm good at I learned self taught. So basically I can't get a career in that type of stuff unless I go to school for it. But it's hard to. It's basically easier if I teach myself then I take some type of a class to do it and everything because. Yeah. Yeah. Just basically the fact I'm a freaky genius. Okay. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Thank you. Have a good day.

B So whenever she's done, she'll let you know, and then you can press this button. C Okay. A Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? C Yes. A Okay. So how are you doing today? C Good, how are you? A I'm great. Things. Where are you from originally? C I am from Los Angeles. A Really? C Yes. A What are some things you really like about la? C It's center of everything. You can get to all the places you need to go to without having to drive very far. I like being in the city. A What are some things you don't really like about la? C Well, being in la. Also, you're dealing with traffic, a lot of congestion, and obviously the environment. As far as the air quality is not that great, but, you know, you live with that. A I see what you mean. Would you say. C I was a business administration major, so I studied business and after I finished college, I pursued a career in retail operations. A Are you still doing that? C No, as a matter of fact, I am not. I kind of changed career over the last four or five years, so I'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business. A What made you decide to do that? C A couple of factors. After working numerous years in the retail business, I switched over and worked in a creative business, which was a graphic design firm. And I captured a lot of knowledge in the human resources side because I was the operations manager, benefits manager for a small company. A Are you happy you did that? C Yes. I'm very happy I did that. I picked up a lot of knowledge and it's very helpful. A That's great. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? C Well, my dream job is I'm basically kind of doing what I want to do now because I am a independent contractor, I do freelance work as an HR consultant using all the knowledge that I gained from previous jobs. And I utilize that with the flexibility to do the things I want to do as far as personally and have the time I need to do the things I want to do. And obviously I worked hard early part of my career. So the financial aspect of my retirement is already set in place. So I do what I need to do as far as maintaining a certain lifestyle. But also I also enjoy what I do. I'm not under as much stress as I used to be. A That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? C I'm not. Well, I'm not totally outgoing, but I'm not extremely shy. I'm probably right in the middle. Maybe more towards outgoing, but I'm not totally outgoing. I mean, when I'm around other people, I am in a social situation. I guess you could consider me an outgoing person. Obviously I do have my own little private issues that I keep to myself. A Can you tell me about that? C Oh, sure. You know, I have. A couple years ago I had a heart attack and I had bypass operation and it had to do with stress and things like that. I don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me. If I meet someone new, I don't just openly say, well, you know, I've experienced this, this and this. I just basically, if it comes up, I won't deny it. Or if it comes up, and if I feel like it's something to talk about, I will talk about it. A Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? C Actually, my relaxation is I'm currently living with my mom, my mother and she's a senior citizen. She's alone. So what I do for relaxation or to relieve stress is actually help her do yard work, take care of all the gardening and things like that. That's actually very therapeutic, you know. A How are you at controlling your temper? C I'm not a short fused kind of person. It takes a lot to get me really angry. So as far as my temper is concerned, there's not much to that. A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? C I'm trying to think here. I can't recall when the last time it was, but it was probably last year sometime when I had a creditor that I was dealing with being very difficult to work with, and I owed money as far as some medical expenses that were incurred when I had my heart attack a few years ago. And they weren't very understanding of the situation. And I really got a little upset about that because I felt like I was being honest with them and I was more than willing to take care of my issues, but they were playing hardball and I didn't care for that. A That sucks. C It does. A Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. C Probably the hardest decision I ever had to make was it had to do with a life and death situation with my stepfather who was battling prostate cancer and making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was going to either help him, there was a slight chance it was going to help him, even though he was pretty terminal at that point, or it would kill him, you know, and that was really tough. It was really tough decision to make. But, you know, I felt like if I didn't try and see if we could help save his life or if we didn't take a chance and take that extra step, that I would regret it in the long run. A Yeah, that sounds really hard. C It is. It was. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. C Well, right now I'm separated from my wife, so she has her issues, I have my issues. But we are not divorced. We are just separated. And we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other. We just don't live together. And the relationship with my mother is really great. You know, she's very understanding. I'm an only child, so she likes having me around, which is good because she's in her late. She's in her later stage of her life. She's 82 years old, and. And so she needs to. I guess it's good that in its own way, maybe fate has taken place because, you know, someone 82 years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing. But with me there, I think there's a comfort level she feels with me there, especially being her only child. A What's something you feel guilty about? C Probably the most guilty I feel about anything are the things that I did to hurt my marriage. As far as the Things that I did, the selfish things that I did when I was much younger, that obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife. A Can you give me an example of that? C Yeah. I got caught up in a situation where I was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lot of stress. My wife was also working a lot of hours in a job that she had, and we were growing apart. And when she was away, my form of release was to go to the casinos and gamble. And so, you know, I spent a lot of time in the casinos. And what eventually happened was I spent a lot of money. And obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship, had to do with trust, because it was devastating to my wife. A How did you feel in that moment? C I felt. When it came to light, I felt very guilty, and I felt less than a human being at that point in my life. A I'm sorry. Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? C No, not at all. A Have you been diagnosed with depression? C No, not really. No. A How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? C I don't have problems sleeping. I don't ever recall having any problems sleeping. No, not at all. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? C No. The only thing I could say is, after I had my heart attack a few years ago, I don't let. I find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before. So I tend to be a little bit more easygoing, and my friends and family have noticed that. A That's great. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. C The last time I felt really happy, probably when I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack, and he basically said to me that after many tests and many months of rehabilitation, that he was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue, no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart attack, and that I could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as I watched my diet and took my medications. A That's so good to hear. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? C Well, I guess number one thing is my physical being itself. I like to be a little bit more healthier, lose some more weight. Just in general, just be more healthier physically and as far as mentally, just not go back to those ways of thinking where I was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish. A How do you cope with them just. C One day at a time? You know, I just try to be at peace with myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis. I meditate, I read some books, I watch tv. I do things that I know that if I can. If I can help myself, I do things to help myself. A Is there anything you regret? C There's a lot that I regret, obviously, my marriage, my working career, as far as I had a long career with this major food chain, and I basically, because of my gambling issues, I ended up ruining a very good career. But at this point right now, there's not much I can do. I can't change what's been done. So I don't focus too much on the past. I just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me every day. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? C What advice? Wake up and see what you're doing to yourself and make the changes that need to be changed. I'm not someone that's not intelligent, but I was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong. And what you're doing is wrong. You need to change your behavior immediately. A What are you most proud of in your life? C Probably what I'm proud about overall is the fact that I did all these awful things. But deep down, I don't think as a person I'm a bad person. I have to remember that when I was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior, it was because I had an illness, a compulsive, obsessive, compulsive behavior that made me ill and that I was a sick person just trying to become healthy every day. That's what my life is about. It's about recovery and just making sure that I do the right things from the time I wake up in the morning to the time I go to sleep at night. One day at a time. A How hard is that? C It's not as hard as you think, but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and just know that what's not right for you, you know, it could be okay for other people to do certain things, but I cannot do those things anymore. A How would your best friend describe you? C Most of my best friends describe me as probably easygoing, generous, a nice person to be around, and, you know, they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues related to the gambling and the breakup of my marriage, which, you know, it's still not over yet, you know. A Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. C My ideal weekend starts off usually after I have breakfast with my mother early in the morning, like around 6:00, I go to a local park and it's about. This park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill. It's about three and a half miles. And I take a brisk walk in the morning, get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going. And then after that I, you know, go home, work in the yard a few hours, take a shower and relax and then just kind of kick back for the rest of the day. And then the next day I do the same thing again. In the morning I go for a walk, work out in the yard, watch tv, whatever. Just relax. That's how a weekend goes for me. A Nice. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. C Thank you. A Goodbye. C Bye. Lock yourself out. A And take the headset off. C Okay. I actually got comfortable talking to him. Good. If that's the way the future is going to be, like if you're going to talk to a therapist, it's pretty cool.",0,okay great b everyth set c okay b go pull go ask question let know finish c okay someth

A When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? B I think I argued with someone a couple of weeks back. It was about a religion. Religious issue. A How did you feel in that moment? B Um. Felt okay. A Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. B Let's see. Can't think of one right now. Let's see. Maybe when I was doing one of my real estate sales. A Can you tell me about that? B I was. Sometimes the clients are pretty. Pretty difficult. And I think I should have been, like, a little more assertive with them. A I see what you mean. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. B Probably moving to California. A Tell me more about that. B Well, I was leaving my friends and family in Texas and pretty much starting a new life out in California. Out here. A How hard is that? B Well, it was pretty difficult, but I got adjusted. A Tell me about your relationship with your family. B Well, I have only an aunt and a few cousins left, so it's not too much of a relationship. I have an aunt that's the sister of my mom, and I send her text periodically, but most of the time I really don't have much contact with family. A Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? B Um, probably parents. Both have been very supportive. A Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. B Mmm. Probably when the parents were sick and passed away. A I'm sorry to hear that. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? B No. A Can you tell me about that? B Well, both parents were. I got sick and got dementia and, you know, one parent didn't remember who I was, so that part was pretty difficult. A Wow. How do you cope with them? B Well, they passed away, so it's just. It's been about 10 years, so it's just memories now. A Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? B Not too easy. A Why? B Just tossing and turning all night, I think. And probably thinking too much about things. A Like what? B Probably like the future. Things like the economy and my work. Things like that. A What are you like when you don't sleep? Well. B Tired. A How have you been feeling lately? B Tired. A Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? B Just not as positive. A Have you ever been diagnosed with ptsd? B No. A Have you been diagnosed depression? B No. A Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. B Probably a few weeks ago. I received a pretty good real estate commission, so I was happy about that. A That's good. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. B When I'm in la, going to some of the meetup groups or some. Some of the. I like going to Whole Foods and then trying some new places to go salsa dancing. A Okay. Is there anything you regret? B No. A What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? B Probably to be more outgoing. A What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? B Probably be more successful in business. Be a little more outgoing. A Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. B Probably my boss. He's pretty condescending and really likes to belittle people and put himself as the king. So he says a lot of comments to make himself, build himself up and belittle whoever else is in the room. A Can you give me an example of that? B Well, usually when you go in, he likes to brag on how much money he's made in the business and then say things like, see how much better I am than you are. Look how much money I've made this year. And you're the worst piece of shit agent there is. Things like that. A That sucks. B Mm. A What would you say are some of your best qualities? B Um. Probably have integrity and good heart. Hard working, honest. A Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. B Probably. I just went, I guess some of the times I've gone dancing. I went to a casino in a little town called Temecula. I met a lot of new friends and did dancing and meeting friends. New friends. A That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? B Probably well, that education, I guess. My education and able to move. Move out here where I wanted to go. A Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. B Thank you. A Goodbye. B Bye.
